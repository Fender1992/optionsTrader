Awesome project. Here’s a clean, production-friendly starter you can run locally that pulls ~10 years of data, engineers a big set of features, trains a model to predict forward returns, ranks stocks, backtests a top-N portfolio, and serves picks via a tiny API.

Download the starter project (zip)

What you’re getting
Data → Features → Model → Backtest → API pipeline in Python.

60+ technical features out of the box (RSI/MACD/ADX/ATR/OBV/CMF/MFI/TSI/CCI/BBands/Donchian/Keltner/EMA/SMA(50/200)/PPO/TRIX/KAMA/PSAR, multi-horizon returns & vol, ADV/turnover, etc.).

Hooks for fundamentals (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, gross profitability, ROE/ROA, margins, leverage, growth, dividends/buybacks), analyst data, short interest, options, and sentiment—wire them up when you add an API (Polygon, Tiingo, FMP, Finnhub, etc.).

LightGBM regression to predict 1-month forward returns; monthly or weekly cross-sectional rank top-N backtest with basic costs and turnover.

FastAPI endpoint to return ranked picks for any date in your dataset.

Run it (quick)
# 1) create env & install
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2) configure universe/dates
# edit config.yaml (start: 2014-01-01; end: 2025-01-01)
# edit data/symbols.csv with your tickers

# 3) fetch + feature engineer
python scripts/build_feature_store.py

# 4) train + backtest (top-N monthly by default)
python scripts/run_backtest.py

# 5) (optional) serve ranks
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8080
# GET http://localhost:8080/rank?asof=2024-12-31
Metrics you can use (10-year friendly)

give me a prompt to pass into claude code. I plan on using alpha advantage.co as the new tracking. Are there any other services that would further optomize this application?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 21s
Great plan—and just to confirm, you mean Alpha Vantage (alphavantage.co), not “alpha advantage.co”. Below is a drop-in prompt you can paste into Claude Code to retrofit the starter I gave you so it pulls 10+ years from Alpha Vantage, handles rate limits, and wires fundamentals scaffolding. After that, I’ll list other services that can supercharge your pipeline.

Paste this into Claude Code
Goal: Add an Alpha Vantage–based data layer + feature/fundamental ingestion to a Python quant starter (FastAPI + LightGBM) with robust caching, retries, and backtesting integration.

Repository assumptions (adjust if different):

scripts/build_feature_store.py

src/fetchers/yahoo.py (replace with alpha_vantage.py)

src/features/technical.py, src/features/fundamental.py

src/utils/data.py, src/labeling.py

scripts/run_backtest.py

config.yaml, .env

What to implement (step-by-step):

Create src/fetchers/alpha_vantage.py:

Functions:

fetch_daily_adjusted(symbol: str, start: str, end: str) -> pd.DataFrame

Use TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED endpoint (split/dividend adjusted). Include columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, AdjClose, Volume, Ticker.

Respect rate limits: free tiers are constrained; implement exponential backoff + jitter on HTTP 429 and the “Thank you for using Alpha Vantage!” throttling message. Cache responses to .cache/raw/{symbol}.json and normalize to .parquet.

Support incremental updates: if cached, only request last 90 days and merge.

fetch_symbol_search(query: str) to resolve tickers.

Add a shared _request(params) with:

Base URL: https://www.alphavantage.co/query

apikey from ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY (.env)

Retries (max 8), backoff (250ms → 20s), detect throttle strings, and graceful failover.

Wire provider selection:

In config.yaml add:

provider: "alphavantage"
alpha:
  function: "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED"
  outputsize: "full"     # for 10+ years
  max_workers: 2         # keep low for free tier
Update scripts/build_feature_store.py to import src.fetchers.alpha_vantage.fetch_daily_adjusted when provider == "alphavantage".

Caching & storage:

Save raw normalized bars per symbol to .cache/{symbol}.parquet.

Add a DuckDB/Parquet merge helper so building the feature store doesn’t re-fetch unchanged symbols.

If Alpha Vantage returns more than needed, trim by start_date/end_date.

Feature engineering:

Reuse src/features/technical.py. Ensure the input columns match (especially AdjClose), then run the existing pipeline.

Fundamentals scaffolding:

In src/features/fundamental.py, add a stub load_alpha_fundamentals(symbols, start, end) that:

Creates a schema for future metrics (PE, PB, EV/EBITDA, profitability, growth, leverage, dividend metrics).

Loads whatever Alpha Vantage fundamental endpoints you have access to (leave TODOs if plan doesn’t include fundamentals).

Merges with price features via merge_price_fundamentals (as-of join, backward).

Environment & config:

Add .env.example key ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=.

Update README.md with rate limits, caching, and incremental update instructions.

Tests & validation:

Add tests/test_alpha_fetcher.py:

Mocks API responses (throttle message, empty, normal).

Ensures schema correctness and incremental update logic.

Quick smoke script scripts/smoke_alpha.py to fetch 1 symbol and print head/tail.

Backtest integration:

No changes needed to scripts/run_backtest.py except ensuring features.parquet columns are consistent.

Write artifacts/equity_curve.csv and artifacts/metrics.csv as before.

CLI examples (document in README):

export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
python scripts/build_feature_store.py   # now uses Alpha Vantage
python scripts/run_backtest.py
Edge cases & constraints:

Handle days with missing data (holidays/IPO gaps).

If API returns throttle/empty, retry with backoff; if still empty, skip symbol and log.

Enforce no look-ahead (labels are forward returns).

Keep max_workers small to avoid ban on free tiers.

Use outputsize=full initially; later switch to incremental.

Acceptance criteria:

scripts/build_feature_store.py completes on 5–10 symbols with Alpha Vantage only.

data/features.parquet exists with 60+ engineered features + base OHLCV.

scripts/run_backtest.py runs and prints metrics.

Caching verified (2nd run is fast; only incremental fetch occurs).

Graceful behavior under throttling (no crashes, logs warnings).

Files to create/update:

src/fetchers/alpha_vantage.py (new)

scripts/build_feature_store.py (provider switch)

src/features/fundamental.py (alpha scaffolding function + TODOs)

.env.example, README.md, tests/test_alpha_fetcher.py, scripts/smoke_alpha.py

Coding style:

Python 3.10+, typing hints, pandas, requests (or httpx), tenacity for retries (if available), duckdb optional.

Small, testable functions; clear logging.

Other services that can further optimize your app

Awesome—going Alpha Vantage Premium is a solid move. It lifts the daily cap (premium advertises “no daily limits”), so you can pull broad universes and deeper fundamentals with fewer headaches. 
Alpha Vantage

Below is a ready-to-paste prompt for Claude Code that will upgrade the starter to Alpha Vantage Premium, wire in core fundamentals, and safely parallelize within Alpha Vantage’s guidance.

Prompt for Claude Code
Context: I have a Python quant starter with these files:
scripts/build_feature_store.py, scripts/run_backtest.py, src/fetchers/*, src/features/technical.py, src/features/fundamental.py, src/labeling.py, src/utils/data.py, config.yaml, .env.example.

Goal: Replace Yahoo fetching with Alpha Vantage Premium for 10+ years of Daily Adjusted bars, add fundamentals ingestion, handle throttling gracefully, and keep outputs compatible with the existing feature engineering / backtest.

Requirements:

New fetcher: src/fetchers/alpha_vantage.py

Implement:

fetch_daily_adjusted(symbol: str, start: str, end: str) -> pd.DataFrame using TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED (provides OHLCV + AdjClose + splits/dividends; 20+ yrs). Normalize to columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, AdjClose, Volume, Ticker. Trim to [start, end]. 
Alpha Vantage

Use requests or httpx with retries, exponential backoff, and detection of throttle strings (keep even on premium for robustness). Base URL https://www.alphavantage.co/query.

Read ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY from .env.

Caching: write normalized Parquet per symbol to .cache/{symbol}.parquet. If cache exists, only fetch recent history and merge (incremental).

Parallelism: add a thread pool with configurable max_workers in config.yaml (default 4–6 for premium; keep graceful fallback to 1 if throttled).

Provider switch in scripts/build_feature_store.py

In config.yaml, add:

provider: "alphavantage"
alpha:
  function: "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED"
  outputsize: "full"
  max_workers: 6
If provider == "alphavantage", import and call fetch_daily_adjusted per symbol and concatenate.

Fundamentals wiring in src/features/fundamental.py

Add load_alpha_fundamentals(symbols: list, start: str, end: str) -> pd.DataFrame that queries selected Alpha Vantage Fundamental Data endpoints (CSV/JSON) and returns a long-format table keyed by Date, Ticker.

Start with endpoints:

OVERVIEW (valuation/profitability/ratios),

INCOME_STATEMENT, BALANCE_SHEET, CASH_FLOW (historical statements),

EARNINGS (EPS surprises) and EARNINGS_CALENDAR (forward dates).
Link to documentation in comments. 
documentation.alphavantage.co
Alpha Vantage

Compute a few canonical ratios if missing: pe, pb, ev_ebitda, gross_profitability, roe, roa, debt_to_equity, div_yield, net_issuance (if fields available).

Merge with price features via as-of join (backward fill to the latest report date).

Batch/utility endpoints

(Optional) Add a helper for batch quotes where applicable (Alpha Vantage offers a batch-quote style endpoint; not for full history, but useful for sanity checks). Document limitations vs. time-series fetch. 
Postman
Stack Overflow

File/Config updates

.env.example: add ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=

README.md: new setup steps, notes on premium “no daily limits”, and why we still keep backoff handling. 
Alpha Vantage

config.yaml: fields above; keep start_date, end_date, universe_file, top_n, rebalance_freq.

Acceptance tests

Add scripts/smoke_alpha.py to fetch 2–3 symbols (e.g., AAPL/MSFT/SPY), build features, and print head/tail.

Ensure scripts/run_backtest.py runs end-to-end and writes artifacts/equity_curve.csv, artifacts/metrics.csv.

Quality & Edge cases

Ensure AdjClose present and consistent; fill holidays/gaps; log and skip empty responses.

Keep no look-ahead: labels are forward returns computed post feature-assembly.

Maintain the existing schema so src/features/technical.py and the backtester don’t change.

Coding style: Python 3.10+, type hints, structured logging, small testable functions.

You said:
Ok I want the application to auto buy and sell the stocks for me. Is that possible?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9s
Short answer: yes—it’s absolutely possible. You can connect your model to a broker’s API and have it place, cancel, and manage orders automatically. You’ll want to add an execution layer to the research starter I gave you, plus strong risk controls and monitoring.

Two good ways to execute
Alpaca Markets (stocks/ETFs, REST/WebSocket, paper trading + live): simple REST API, great for first automation projects.

Interactive Brokers (IBKR, stocks/options/futures): very full-featured via TWS / IB Gateway API; steeper learning curve but institutional-grade.

(Other choices: TradeStation, Tradier, Schwab API, Robinhood Unofficial—I'd stick to Alpaca or IBKR for reliability and docs.)

How to bolt this onto your starter
Add an execution/ module with:

Signal→Order translator: turns your ranked list into orders (e.g., equal-weight top-N; rebalance on month-end).

Broker adapter(s): AlpacaBroker, IBBroker implementing a common interface.

Risk & compliance guardrails: max position %, sector caps, max leverage, notional limits, kill switch, trading-hours checks, order throttling, duplicate-order idempotency.

Portfolio & order state: pull current positions, open orders; compute diffs before placing anything.

Logging & alerts: write every decision; send alerts on rejects/halts; include a manual “pause trading” flag.

    def cancel_all(self):
        requests.delete(f"{self.base}/v2/orders", headers=self.h, timeout=15)
Rebalance loop (monthly/weekly)
Generate target weights from your predictions (e.g., equal-weight top-N).

Read current positions and cash.

Compute desired share quantities (respect lot size, min notional, cash buffer).

Submit orders (prefer limit or market-on-open/close depending on your design).

Confirm fills; retry/cancel/replace logic if partially filled or rejected.

Safety & compliance (please read)
Paper trade first. Run your full pipeline in paper for weeks to validate slippage, fills, and behavior at rebalances.

Guardrails: daily loss limit, per-position cap (e.g., ≤10% of portfolio), sector caps, turnover cap, circuit-breaker (“pause if drawdown > X%”), and a manual kill switch.

Market hours: don’t fire during halts/after-hours unless you explicitly support it.

Taxes & rules: pattern day-trader, margin, short-sale locate/borrow—know your broker’s policies.

Secrets: store API keys in env vars / secret manager; rotate keys; log only order IDs (not secrets).

Where Alpha Vantage fits
Alpha Vantage remains your research/data layer (signals). For execution, you’ll still use a broker API (Alpaca/IBKR). That separation is healthy:

Research data vendor(s) → Signal Service

Broker API → Order Management & Execution

Database (SQLite/Postgres/DuckDB) → State, logs, fills, PnL

Optional upgrades
Position sizing: volatility targeting (e.g., scale by inverse 20-day vol) or risk parity within top-N.

Order types: bracket orders (take-profit/stop), VWAP/TWAP (IBKR), market-on-close rebalances.

Monitoring: a tiny status page (FastAPI) + email/SMS alerts for exceptions and large slippage.

Job orchestration: Prefect/Cron to fetch → train → rebalance on a schedule.

Paper/live toggle: one env flag (EXECUTION_MODE=paper|live) switching base URLs/keys.

If you want, I can generate a drop-in execution/ package (broker interface + Alpaca + a monthly rebalance script) tailored to the starter so you can paper-trade today and flip to live when you’re ready.

You said:
Will I be able to add a dollar amout to the application and the app does the rest?
ChatGPT said:
Yes 👍 — you can absolutely design it so you type in (or configure) a dollar amount and the app does the rest (fetch signals, size positions, send orders). That’s a standard step called portfolio sizing & order management.

Here’s how it would work:

1. Dollar Input → Portfolio Target
You supply $10,000 (or any capital amount).

The app:

Reads current model rankings (top-N picks).

Assigns weights (equal weight, volatility-scaled, risk parity, etc.).

Converts weights × total capital into dollar allocations per stock.

Example:
$10,000 capital, 5 stocks, equal weight = $2,000 per stock.
At $200/share = 10 shares.

2. Broker Adapter Executes
Broker API (e.g., Alpaca or IBKR) places orders for that number of shares.

The app checks your cash balance and open positions, adjusts sizes if needed.

Handles fractional shares if supported (Alpaca supports; IBKR does too with certain account types).

3. Ongoing Automation
On each rebalance date (weekly/monthly):

Pull current capital (cash + equity).

Recompute target weights.

Calculate buy/sell deltas.

Send only the difference as orders (so you don’t close/reopen the same size).

4. Safety Features You Must Add
Cash buffer: e.g., keep 2–5% in cash to cover slippage/fees.

Position caps: max % per stock (e.g., ≤20%).

Stop if allocation < minimum lot size (don’t buy 0.3 shares unless broker supports fractional).

Kill switch: one flag/env var to pause all live orders.

Paper trading first to verify everything before touching real money.

Putting It All Together
So yes: you can have a config or UI field like:

initial_capital: 10000
allocation_mode: equal_weight   # or vol_target, top_n_equal, etc.
rebalance_freq: M
…and your app will turn that $10,000 into the correct orders at rebalance time.

⚠️ Important note: Once you move from research to live auto-trading, you’re entering regulated, high-risk territory. You must:

Use only brokers with proper APIs.

Comply with your jurisdiction’s trading rules.

Expect bugs, outages, and slippage — so test in paper mode first.

👉 Do you want me to generate a drop-in execution/ package (with a rebalance.py that takes capital: $X and fires orders via Alpaca paper trading) so you can test this end-to-end?

You said:
No I want the full prompt now that will allow me to send real funds. The app will begin to check the news api's and begin execution based on historical data to focus on making the most money based on options trading. I need to be able to access it from my phone and I am the only one that can access it and it does it for me.

Totally doable. Here’s a copy-paste “Claude Code” prompt that will turn the starter into a single-user, mobile-friendly, fully automated options trading app that (1) ingests 10+ years of data, (2) blends historical + news/sentiment signals, and (3) can place real-money options orders via a broker API—with strong guardrails (paper/live switch, kill-switch, risk limits, 2FA login).

⚠️ Educational/research use only. Not investment advice. You are responsible for compliance, broker agreements, market-data entitlements, and taxes. Always validate in paper trading before live.

PROMPT (paste into Claude Code)
Context: Repo already has: scripts/build_feature_store.py, scripts/run_backtest.py, src/features/*, src/models/*, src/backtest/*, src/utils/*, app.py, config.yaml, .env.example. You will add a news/sentiment layer, an options model, and a live execution layer with a mobile-friendly single-user UI.

Goal:

Pull 10+ years of EOD bars (Alpha Vantage Premium) and compute features.

Add news & sentiment signals (Alpha Vantage News & Sentiment; optional Finnhub).

Build an options strategy engine using the underlying signal + IV context.

Execute real options orders via a broker API (Tradier or Interactive Brokers), with paper/live switch.

Provide a single-user, phone-friendly PWA UI (login + TOTP 2FA) to arm/disarm trading, view positions, PnL, logs.

Strict safeties: kill switch, position caps, loss limits, trading window checks.

1) Alpha Vantage Premium Fetcher (prices + news)
Create src/fetchers/alpha_vantage.py:

Functions:

fetch_daily_adjusted(symbol, start, end) -> pd.DataFrame using TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED; normalize to columns Date, Open, High, Low, Close, AdjClose, Volume, Ticker; cache per symbol .cache/{symbol}.parquet; incremental merge.

fetch_news_alphavantage(symbols, start, end) -> pd.DataFrame using News & Sentiment API; fields: published_time, ticker, title, summary, overall_sentiment_score, overall_sentiment_label, relevance_score, source.

Robust retries/backoff on throttle signals (even premium) and HTTP 429/5xx.

(Refs: Alpha Vantage docs for Daily Adjusted & News/Sentiment, and Premium page stating “no daily limits”.) 
Alpha Vantage

Optional src/fetchers/finnhub.py:

fetch_news_finnhub(symbols, start, end) and/or fetch_news_sentiment for redundancy. 
Finnhub
+1

2) News → Sentiment Features
Create src/features/news.py:

build_news_features(news_df, price_calendar) -> pd.DataFrame:

Filter by relevance_score >= cfg.news.min_confidence.

Map each article to its tickers; daily aggregate per ticker: mean/median sentiment score, article count, source diversity.

Rolling windows (e.g., 1d, 3d, 5d) to get sent_1d, sent_5d, news_count_5d, news_volatility_5d.

Optional decay weighting (recent articles weigh more).

As-of join back into the main features table (no look-ahead).

3) Options Data Interfaces
Create src/options/data.py:

Interface to obtain chains & greeks and compute helpers:

If Tradier broker selected: use Tradier Market Data endpoints to pull option chains with greeks & IV (hourly-updated greeks, per Tradier docs). Functions:

get_chain_tradier(symbol, dte_target_range, trade_date) -> pd.DataFrame

select_contract_by_delta(chain, target_delta, right='call') -> row

compute_iv_rank(symbol, window=252) -> float

If IBKR: add a placeholder adapter that queries TWS/IBGW for chains/greeks (user must have data entitlements enabled).

(Refs: Tradier options chain & greeks; IBKR options API.) 
documentation.tradier.com

interactivebrokers.github.io

4) Strategy Engine (Options)
Create src/options/strategy.py:

Given ranked underlyings (from your model + features + news sentiment):

Bullish: buy nearest delta≈0.35 call with DTE in [30,45].

Risk controls: if IV rank is very high (e.g., ≥0.8), prefer bull call spread to reduce vega risk.

Bearish (if you implement shorts): buy delta≈0.35 puts or bear put spreads.

Earnings/news gating: if earnings within ±N days (cfg) or extreme negative news spike today, skip opening new longs.

Exit logic: take-profit at +50%, stop at −50%, or time-based exit at DTE<7; also exit on rebalance.

Return a target book: list of {symbol, contract, qty, side, rationale, tp, sl}.

5) Execution Layer (REAL money capable)
Create src/execution/broker.py (interface) and two adapters:

src/execution/tradier_broker.py

Endpoints for account, balances, positions, place order (options), cancel order.

Use TRADIER_ENV (paper|live) to choose base URL; include OAuth bearer header.

Validate only trading during configured hours and days.

Place limit orders by default; retry/cancel/replace if not filled.

Notes: Tradier supports options trading by API and exposes greeks/IV in chain endpoints. 
documentation.tradier.com

src/execution/ibkr_broker.py

Thin wrapper for TWS/IB Gateway (socket API or Client Portal).

Map contract selection + order placement; ensure TIF/market hours respected.

Notes: IB API supports options greeks/IV and trading. 
interactivebrokers.github.io
Interactive Brokers

Shared safeguards (enforce before any order goes out):

If EXECUTION_MODE != "live", block live orders.

If KILL_SWITCH == true, block all orders.

Cash buffer (e.g., 3%).

Max positions and per-name weight caps.

Daily loss limit & absolute drawdown circuit breaker.

Idempotency keys to avoid duplicate orders if retried.

Comprehensive logging of intent, request, response, and fills.

6) Portfolio Sizing
Create src/execution/sizer.py:

Input: capital_dollars (from UI), ranked underlyings, optional volatility scales.

Allocate per-trade notional with caps & min notional; translate to contracts given option price.

If fractional contracts not allowed (true), round down; if below min notional → skip.

7) Schedulers & Orchestration
Add src/jobs/scheduler.py using APScheduler:

Daily pre-open: fetch/update data (prices, news).

During trade window: build signals, rank underlyings, update options chains, compute targets.

On rebalance days: diff current vs. target and place/cancel orders.

End-of-day: reconcile fills, write PnL, rotate logs.

8) Mobile-Friendly Single-User UI (PWA)
Upgrade app.py (FastAPI + Jinja2 templates):

Auth:

Single username + bcrypt password hash + TOTP 2FA (pyotp).

Optional IP allowlist check.

Short-lived session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict.

Views (mobile responsive with Tailwind/HTMX):

Dashboard: capital, positions, open orders, PnL, equity curve.

ARM/DISARM toggle (changes KILL_SWITCH at runtime).

Mode switch: paper ↔ live.

Logs: last 200 actions with broker responses.

Settings: set capital amount (e.g., $10,000) used for sizing.

PWA: add manifest.json + service worker so you can “Install to Home Screen” on your phone.

9) Wire It All Together
Extend scripts/build_feature_store.py to fetch Alpha Vantage prices and store features.

New script scripts/build_news_features.py to fetch news (Alpha Vantage; optional Finnhub) and write data/news_features.parquet.

Update scripts/run_backtest.py to merge news features into the ML table (as-of join).

New script scripts/run_live_cycle.py:

Load features + latest predictions + news features.

Rank underlyings.

Build option targets (contracts).

Size by capital_dollars (from DB/env/UI).

Broker adapter: place/cancel orders respecting guards and window.

Persist state to artifacts/live/ (positions snapshot, orders, fills, PnL).

Acceptance Criteria:

You can log in on your phone, pass TOTP, see dashboard/PWA.

Flip to paper mode: see paper orders route and fills.

Flip to live mode: orders go to broker only if (a) trading window open, (b) kill-switch off, (c) caps respected.

News features present and affect rankings.

Options engine selects contracts by delta/DTE and enforces exits (TP/SL/time).

All actions logged with timestamps and broker responses.

10) Helpful CLI
Add to README:

# one-time: create password hash
python -c "from passlib.hash import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hash('YourStrongPassword'))"

# build features & news
python scripts/build_feature_store.py
python scripts/build_news_features.py

# train & evaluate
python scripts/run_backtest.py

# run web app (PWA UI)
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

make this better to add to the prompt: When gains are made I want to reinvest the gains to get compounding returns. 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a tightened version you can drop straight into your build-prompt so Claude knows to wire it in correctly:

Compounding & Reinvestment Requirement:

All realized gains (profits from closed positions, dividends, interest, or premiums) should automatically be reinvested back into the strategy so that the portfolio compounds over time.

The sizing engine must always use current account equity (cash + market value of open positions) rather than just the original starting capital.

On each rebalance, re-calculate target allocations based on the updated equity. This ensures that profits increase the dollar amount available for new positions and losses reduce it, creating a true compounding effect.

Maintain safety constraints (cash buffer %, max position %, notional minimums) even as equity grows.

Would you like me to also show you where to insert this block in the full Claude Code prompt I gave you earlier (e.g., under “Portfolio Sizing” / src/execution/sizer.py)?

You said:
I want the app to notify me when ever the funds in my account as double. Integrate into the past prompt.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect—here’s a crisp block you can drop straight into your Claude Code prompt. It adds “funds doubled” alerts, handles repeated doublings (2×, 4×, 8×…), and wires them into the scheduler + mobile UI.

Equity-Doubling Alerts (Milestone Notifications)
Goal: Notify me immediately when my account equity has doubled relative to a configurable baseline (and each subsequent doubling: 2×, 4×, 8×, …).

Config (add to config.yaml):

alerts:
  equity_doubling:
    enabled: true
    baseline_mode: "initial_capital"   # "initial_capital" | "custom"
    custom_baseline: null              # set a number to override, e.g., 10000
    channels: ["pwa_push", "email"]    # "pwa_push" | "email" | "sms"
    email_to: "you@example.com"
    sms_to: null
    check_freq: "D"                    # D = daily after close; can be "W" or "M"
    timezone: "America/New_York"
State persistence (new lightweight table/file):

Create artifacts/live/state.json (or a tiny SQLite table) with:

equity_baseline (float)

highest_equity_seen (float)

last_milestone_power (int) # 0 means baseline, 1 means 2× hit, 2 means 4× hit, etc.

Computation:

Define equity as cash + market value of open positions (same definition used for sizing/compounding).

On app init:

If baseline_mode == "initial_capital": set equity_baseline = initial_capital (from config/UI) unless already stored.

If baseline_mode == "custom" and custom_baseline is set: use that.

After each EOD reconciliation (or at check_freq time):

Update highest_equity_seen = max(highest_equity_seen, current_equity).

Compute current_milestone_power = floor(log2(current_equity / equity_baseline)) if current_equity >= equity_baseline, else 0.

If current_milestone_power > last_milestone_power:

Trigger one notification (idempotent) for this milestone:
“🎉 Equity milestone reached: {current_equity:,.2f} (≥ {2**current_milestone_power}× baseline {equity_baseline:,.2f})”

Persist last_milestone_power = current_milestone_power.

Idempotency & Spam control:

Store a milestone_id = f"2x^{current_milestone_power}" and the timestamp in state.json to avoid duplicate alerts if the scheduler reruns.

Only alert on first crossing; do not re-alert on drawdown/rebound unless a new power-of-two threshold is exceeded.

Integrations:

Scheduler: In src/jobs/scheduler.py, add a job at check_freq in alerts.timezone after EOD mark-to-market, calling alerts.check_equity_doubling().

Alerts module: Create src/alerts/notifier.py:

send_pwa_push(title, body) (use the existing PWA service worker / web push if available).

send_email(to, subject, body) (SMTP or transactional API).

send_sms(to, body) (Twilio or similar; optional).

A wrapper notify(channels, subject, body) selecting channels from config.

App UI (PWA):

Add a Milestones card on the dashboard showing:

Baseline, Highest Equity, Last Milestone (e.g., 4×), Next Target (e.g., 8× amount).

Settings page:

Toggle Equity-Doubling Alerts on/off.

Switch baseline_mode and edit custom_baseline.

Test notification button (sends a benign test).

APIs (FastAPI):

GET /api/alerts/equity-doubling → returns current baseline, last milestone power, next milestone value.

POST /api/alerts/equity-doubling/reset (auth + TOTP required) → resets last_milestone_power=0 and sets a new equity_baseline to current equity (useful if I want to “lock in” a new compounding epoch).

POST /api/alerts/test (auth + TOTP) → send a test push/email.

Unit tests / acceptance:

Simulate equity paths: baseline 10k → 19k (no alert) → 20,100 (2× alert) → 39k (no alert) → 40,500 (4× alert).

Verify no duplicate alerts on reruns.

Check that switching baseline_mode to custom picks up the new value and recomputes the next target.

Verify UI shows Next Target amount: equity_baseline * 2^(last_milestone_power+1).

Security:

Alerts endpoints behind session auth + TOTP.

Never expose balances or PII in push payloads beyond what’s necessary (subject + rounded equity is OK if you prefer; or make it generic like “Milestone reached.”).

If you want, I can also give you the exact Python stubs for notifier.py, the scheduler hook, and the FastAPI routes so they slot right into your repo.

I had Claude analyze the return algorithms and returned this: I’ll analyze this options trading application and simulate its performance over the last 12 months with a $10 weekly investment strategy. Let me examine the code structure and backtest methodology to provide realistic metrics.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Analysis Summary: $10 Weekly Investment in Options Trading Platform

Based on my analysis of the options trading application and simulation of 12 months of performance with $10 weekly deposits, here are the key findings:

### **System Overview**

The platform uses:

- **ML-powered signals** (LightGBM/XGBoost) with technical indicators
- **News sentiment analysis** from Alpha Vantage API
- **Options strategies** targeting 0.35 delta with 50% take profit/stop loss
- **Automated execution** via Tradier broker API
- **Risk management** with position limits and kill switches

### **12-Month Performance Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Conservative (45% Win Rate)**

- Total Deposited: **$520**
- Final Portfolio: **$501**
- Net Result: **-$19** (-3.7% return)
- Trades Executed: 31 (after week 20)

#### **Scenario 2: Realistic (52% Win Rate)**

- Total Deposited: **$520**
- Final Portfolio: **$410**
- Net Result: **-$110** (-21.2% return)
- Trades Executed: 33

#### **Scenario 3: Optimistic (58% Win Rate)**

- Total Deposited: **$520**
- Final Portfolio: **$1,874**
- Net Result: **+$1,354** (+260.4% return)
- Trades Executed: 23

### **Key Insights**

1. **Accumulation Period**: First 20 weeks ($200) are savings-only since the minimum options trade requires $200
1. **Compounding Effect**: The system reinvests all gains, amplifying both wins and losses significantly
1. **Critical Success Factors**:
- Win rate above 55% is crucial for profitability
- ML signals and news sentiment analysis are essential
- Risk management (50% stop loss) prevents catastrophic losses
1. **Monthly Volatility**: Results vary dramatically month-to-month due to options leverage

### **⚠️ Important Risks**

- **High Loss Potential**: Options can expire worthless
- **Leverage Risk**: Small market moves cause large P&L swings
- **Execution Costs**: Bid-ask spreads reduce actual returns
- **Assignment Risk**: On short options in spreads
- **Technology Risk**: System failures could cause losses

### **Realistic Expectation**

With disciplined use of ML signals and proper risk management, you might expect returns between -20% to +50% annually, with significant volatility. The optimistic scenario (+260%) requires exceptional market conditions and trading skill.

**Bottom Line**: Starting with $10/week, after 12 months you’d have invested $520 total. Depending on market conditions and system performance, your portfolio could range from $400 (loss) to $1,800+ (exceptional gains), with a realistic expectation around $500-700.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ i need you to reevaluate the app algorithm by assessing all possible metrics based on performance indicators, write them into the application and use them as a reference when executing trades
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 46s
Got it—here’s a clean, production-style upgrade that (a) evaluates robust performance metrics, (b) gates live trading on those metrics, and (c) exposes them via the API/UI so your execution layer “uses them as reference” before placing orders.

Download (drop-in upgrade)
quant-predictor-starter-with-metrics.zip

What’s added:

Performance analytics (src/analytics/metrics.py)

Equity metrics: CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Calmar, Ulcer Index, Time Under Water, Ann. Vol, Skew, Kurtosis.

Trade stats: win rate, profit factor, payoff ratio, expectancy/trade, avg win/loss, entry/exit slippage vs mid, performance by strategy/day-of-week/DTE buckets.

Market-regime filter (src/analytics/regime.py)

Simple trend (50/200) and realized-vol regime; optional gate that blocks new trades in “downtrend + high vol”.

Policy engine (src/policy/trade_policy.py)

Reads rolling metrics, checks configurable thresholds, and returns policy_ok + detailed check results.

Cooldown after violations to avoid thrash.

Designed to be called right before order placement to enforce go/no-go.

Config gates & risk scaling (appended to config.yaml)

metrics_gates: lookback, min Sharpe, max drawdown, min profit factor, min win rate, max ulcer index, regime filter.

risk_scaling: optional multipliers based on recent Sharpe and drawdown bands (for your sizer to scale up/down risk).

Metrics recompute script

scripts/recompute_metrics.py writes artifacts/metrics/live_policy.json used by the API/UI and your execution layer.

FastAPI endpoints

GET /metrics → live metrics + gate check results.

GET /policy/status → boolean policy_ok for quick gating in your order loop.

Trade log scaffold

artifacts/live/trade_log.csv created (columns for pnl, fees, deltas/DTE, slippage, etc.). Your execution layer should append to this on every close/fill.

How to use it in execution
Before placing any orders in your rebalance loop:

Run python scripts/recompute_metrics.py.

Read /policy/status (or the JSON file directly).

If policy_ok == false, skip opening new positions (you may still manage exits).

If you enabled risk_scaling, apply the multiplier to your position sizing.

On each EOD (or on your schedule):

Update equity curve (paper or live).

Append to trade_log.csv as positions close.

Recompute metrics.

Minimal pseudocode (drop into your order loop)
import json, requests, os

# 1) recompute metrics
os.system("python scripts/recompute_metrics.py")

# 2) gate check
policy = json.load(open("artifacts/metrics/live_policy.json"))
if not policy.get("policy_ok", False):
    logger.info("Trade policy blocked new entries: %s", policy.get("checks"))
    return

# 3) optional risk scaling in your sizer
sharpe = policy["equity_metrics"].get("Sharpe", 0)
mdd = policy["equity_metrics"].get("MaxDrawdown", 0)
risk_mult = choose_multiplier_from_config(sharpe, mdd)  # implement in sizer
target_notional = base_notional * risk_mult

# 4) proceed to build orders as usual
Where to plug in
Sizer: read risk_scaling to adjust per-trade notional/contracts.

Broker adapter: call recompute_metrics.py and check policy_ok before creating new orders.

UI: call GET /metrics to display live Sharpe/DD/PF/WR plus which gates are passing/failing.

Notes
This adds objective, rolling KPIs and turns them into hard trade rules (plus optional risk scaling). It pairs well with your compounding behavior and “funds doubled” alerting.

Keep recording all fills (with mid prices at the time) so slippage and profit factor are accurate.

If you want, I can also wire the sizer to apply the risk_scaling multipliers directly and add a small dashboard card showing which gate is blocking when trades are paused.

ChatGPT said:
To tailor the Claude Code prompt effectively, could you clarify a few things about the investing strategy you want it to guide?

Are you focused solely on options trading, or should it also consider stocks, ETFs, or crypto?

Should Claude use both fundamental and technical indicators, or just one?

Do you want it to generate trade signals, portfolio rebalancing logic, or risk management rules as well?

Should the code Claude generates be compatible with your current stack (e.g., Python, FastAPI, Alpha Vantage, Tradier, etc.)?

Is the goal to integrate Claude’s reasoning into live trade execution or use it as a research/thesis engine only?

Once I know these details, I’ll provide a robust Claude Code prompt for you.

Claude Code Prompt for High-Return Options Trading Strategy

Prompt for Claude Code: End-to-End Options Trading System
Objective: Build an automated options trading system designed to maximize returns while managing risk, using technical indicators and news sentiment for signals. The system will generate trading signals with ML models and execute real trades via Tradier API, with robust risk controls and secure access.
1. Focus on Options-Only Trading
The system will trade exclusively in options contracts (calls, puts, spreads, combinations) – no direct stock or ETF trading. It should handle option chains for various underlying symbols and select appropriate contracts to trade. This focus allows strategies that profit from volatility and premium capture, using options' unique properties (e.g. leverage, time decay) for returns. The platform must support multi-leg option strategies (like spreads, straddles, iron condors) and manage options-specific events (e.g. expiration, assignment risk). Rationale: Options provide the flexibility to design trades with defined risk and tailored payoff profiles, which is essential for maximizing risk-adjusted returns. By excluding stocks/ETFs, we ensure the strategy concentrates on options Greeks and volatility dynamics.
2. Data Inputs – Technical Indicators & News Sentiment
Technical Indicators: Integrate a wide range of market technicals to inform trading signals. Use historical price data of underlying assets to compute indicators such as: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc. Alpha Vantage’s API offers over 50 technical indicators (e.g. RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA) that can be fetched programmatically. Additionally, track options-specific metrics like implied volatility (IV) and option greeks (delta, theta, vega) for the underlying’s option chain. The Tradier API can provide real-time option chain data with Greeks and IV (via ORATS integration), which the system should use to gauge market expectations and risk. News-Based Sentiment: Incorporate news sentiment analysis using Alpha Vantage’s news API. Pull news articles and sentiment scores for relevant ticker symbols (Alpha Vantage’s NEWS_SENTIMENT endpoint provides sentiment metrics on queried tickers). The system should analyze this data to quantify market sentiment (e.g. bullish, bearish, neutral) on the underlying. This can include sentiment scores or counts of positive/negative news. Rationale: News and social media can drive short-term price moves; by including sentiment, the strategy bridges technical analysis with market psychology. For example, a strongly negative news sentiment might warn against a bullish technical signal, or vice versa. Data Handling:
Schedule regular data updates (e.g. pull technicals and news sentiment daily or intraday). Use caching or local storage as needed to avoid API rate limits.
Ensure all data is time-synchronized (align indicators with the time of news sentiment).
If needed, use Alpha Vantage’s technical indicators API for simplicity, and combine with custom calculations for option metrics. For sentiment, parse the JSON news feed from Alpha Vantage and extract fields like overall sentiment score or label.
Example: For each underlying stock of interest, retrieve latest RSI, MACD, etc., and the latest news sentiment score (e.g. +0.5 bullish or -0.7 bearish). These form the feature inputs for the model in the next step.
3. Predictive Signal Generation with XGBoost/LightGBM
Leverage machine learning (gradient boosting models) to predict market moves or option strategy outcomes. The system will use XGBoost or LightGBM to generate trading signals based on the compiled features (technical indicators, sentiment, and possibly option-derived metrics):
Model Setup: Define the prediction target. For instance, predict the probability of the underlying stock rising or falling over the next period (e.g. next 5 days for a weekly options strategy), or predict the magnitude of price change, or even direct option strategy outcomes (profit/loss). A classification approach (buy signal vs. sell signal) or regression (expected return) could be used.
Features: Include a rich feature set: recent values of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.), trends or momentum indicators, volatility indices (VIX if relevant), option-implied metrics (current IV percentile), and the news sentiment score. For example, features might be: RSI(14), MACD histogram, 5-day price momentum, implied volatility change, and sentiment score from news. Combining these can improve model accuracy by providing both market technical state and public sentiment context.
Training: Train the XGBoost/LightGBM model on historical data. Use a moving window backtest – e.g., train on the past N months, then test/predict on the next week, rolling forward – to simulate live usage and avoid lookahead bias. Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation or Bayesian tuning for maximum predictive power.
Signal Output: The model should output a signal strength or probability. For example, output could be a value from 0 to 1 where >0.5 indicates a bullish expectation and <0.5 bearish. Alternatively, output could be categories like “Strong Buy”, “Buy”, “Hold”, “Sell” depending on thresholds. This signal will directly inform what option trade to execute (e.g. a strong buy signal could trigger selling a bullish put spread or buying calls).
Ensemble and Multi-Model: Optionally, use an ensemble of models (one might predict direction, another predicts volatility). In a real system, multiple signals improve robustness, as noted by literature that real strategies often use multiple models and signals rather than one. For now, one boosting model combining all features is sufficient, but keep architecture flexible to add more models later (e.g. a separate LightGBM model to predict volatility changes which might inform vega exposure).
Speed and Efficiency: XGBoost/LightGBM are fast and can handle real-time inference easily. The model inference step should be well under a second. Ensure model loading and inference is done at system startup and then reused (avoid re-loading model for each tick).
Continuous Learning: The system can periodically retrain the model with new data (say weekly or monthly) to adapt to regime changes. This could be automated in a background process, ensuring the model stays up-to-date (but also implement safeguards to paper-test new model before fully deploying, to avoid model drift causing losses).
In summary, the ML model turns raw data into an actionable predictive signal. For example: “Model predicts a 70% chance the stock will rise >2% in the next 5 trading days.” This would cue the system to initiate a bullish options strategy.
4. Strategy Selection – Weekly/Monthly Options, Delta Exposure & Premium Capture
Using the model’s signals, the system must choose which options to trade and how to structure the position. Key considerations:
Signal Interpretation: If the ML signal is strongly bullish (high probability of upward move), deploy a bullish strategy; if bearish, a bearish strategy; if neutral or low-confidence, consider a market-neutral income strategy. The magnitude of the signal confidence can determine aggressiveness (e.g. very strong signal => closer to the money options or larger position size).
Option Chain Analysis: Fetch the current option chain for the target expiration(s) from Tradier (which provides quotes, greeks, IV for each strike). The system should filter the chain for desired expiration dates – typically weekly options (expiring within ~7 days) or monthly options (the standard third-Friday expiries, often 30-45 days out). These two will be primary focus, as per the strategy requirement.
Weekly vs. Monthly:
Weekly Options: Use for short-term opportunities and quick theta decay capture. Weekly options have higher theta (time decay) and gamma (sensitivity to underlying moves) – good for short, high-confidence plays. If the model expects a move or mean reversion within days, a weekly option or spread can yield fast profits.
Monthly Options: Use for strategies that need more time or to reduce risk. As many traders note, 30-45 DTE options offer a balance of premium and risk – more premium than weeklies, but less gamma risk and a longer window for the thesis to play out. For example, selling a 30 DTE credit spread gives a decent premium and time for adjustments if needed, with lower chance of sudden 0DTE-style swings.
Delta Exposure and Premium Capture:
The strategy should balance delta exposure (directional risk) with premium capture (income from selling options):
For directional trades (when model strongly bullish/bearish): Aim for a delta-tilted position. For example, if bullish: buy calls or bull call spreads, or sell puts (cash-secured put or bull put spread). Ensure total delta is positive (for bullish) or negative (for bearish) in line with conviction. A rough guideline could be using options with ~0.5 delta for outright calls/puts to mirror underlying moves, or combining multiple contracts to reach a target delta equivalent to, say, a certain % of account equity.
For neutral/income trades (model isn’t picking a strong direction, but we want to earn premium): Construct delta-neutral or delta-light positions that profit from time decay and volatility mean reversion. Classic approaches include short straddles/strangles or iron condors, which have an initial delta ≈ 0. For instance, sell a call and put around the current price (straddle) or with some OTM cushion (strangle), or an iron condor (sell put and call spreads). This yields premium that can be captured if the underlying stays in a range. The system must manage the risk (see execution layer for stop-loss on these unlimited-risk positions). The premium capture is maximized by selling options when IV is high and letting theta work in our favor.
Strike Selection: Use technical and volatility inputs to pick strikes:
If buying options (directional): Consider slightly in-the-money or at-the-money options for a balance of delta and cost, unless it’s a cheap out-of-the-money lottery ticket scenario. For spreads, maybe buy ATM and sell a further OTM to finance.
If selling options (premium capture): Aim for strikes with a reasonable probability of expiring worthless. For example, sell options with delta around 0.15–0.30 (roughly 15-30% chance ITM at expiration). This aligns with common premium-selling practice where you win ~70-85% of the time but keep limited gains. Use model volatility forecasts to perhaps adjust this – e.g., if expecting low volatility, you can sell closer strikes for more premium.
Always check open interest and spreads – ensure strikes chosen have sufficient liquidity to enter/exit with minimal slippage.
Expiration Selection: Typically choose one expiration at a time for a given trade (either the nearest weekly or the next monthly). Over time the system can hold a portfolio of positions across expirations (like some positions expiring this week, some next month), but each triggered trade will decide on one expiration. The choice can depend on the signal’s time horizon (short-term signal => weekly, longer term view or smaller edge => monthly to allow time).
Examples:
Model says strong bullish, short-term news catalyst: Strategy = Bull Call Spread on the weekly expiration (buy call at ATM, sell call at +$5 OTM strike). Delta ≈ +0.3 to +0.5, limited risk, capitalize on quick move.
Model says mild bearish/neutral, high IV: Strategy = Iron Condor on monthly expiration (sell 30-DTE put and call ~15 delta, buy wings ~5 delta for protection). Delta ≈ 0 initially, theta positive, profiting if underlying stays range-bound.
Model says very bearish, volatility low: Strategy = Long Put or Bear Put Spread 4-6 weeks out (to give time for move). Buy slightly ITM put (delta ~ -0.6) and maybe sell a further OTM put to reduce cost.
Balancing Multiple Positions: If multiple signals (for different underlyings or if multiple strategies trigger), ensure overall portfolio delta isn’t overly skewed. For instance, if all signals say bullish, the system will naturally have a net long delta – that’s fine but monitor if it exceeds risk limits. We want the portfolio delta, gamma, vega in check relative to account size.
In summary, the system should algorithmically decide which option chain and strikes to trade such that the position’s Greeks align with the strategy: when seeking premium, keep delta neutral and collect theta; when directional, get the needed delta exposure while minding theta and vega. This careful selection provides the edge (e.g. selling overpriced options, or leveraging predicted moves) while managing risk (not too much directional exposure unless intended).
5. Trade Execution & Management via Tradier API
With a strategy and specific contracts chosen, the system must execute trades through the Tradier brokerage API. This involves placing orders, managing exits (take-profit/stop-loss), and handling any adjustments or rolls. Key aspects:
Placing Orders: Use Tradier’s order placement API to send orders for the selected option contracts. Tradier allows market, limit, stop, and multileg orders. Prefer limit orders for entry to control prices (especially important for options with wide spreads). For multi-leg strategies (spreads, iron condors), Tradier’s API supports combo orders to enter all legs simultaneously. The system should construct the order with the correct specifications: option symbol(s), quantity (number of contracts), side (buy/sell to open/close), order type and limit price, duration (day or GTC). If using limit orders, perhaps set at mid-price and allow some slippage tolerance.
Bracket Orders for TP/SL: Immediately after opening a position, submit exit orders to enforce profit-taking and stop-loss. Tradier supports advanced orders like OCO (one-cancels-other) and OTOCO (one-triggers-OCO). The system can utilize an OTOCO order: the initial trade execution triggers two linked orders – one is a take-profit limit order at a favorable price, and the other a stop-loss order at a worse price. These two are in OCO, so if one executes, the other cancels. This effectively creates a bracket around the position. For example, if we sold an iron condor for a $2.00 credit, we might place a take-profit limit to buy it back at $0.50 (75% profit) and a stop-loss order to buy back at $4.00 (100% loss) – whichever hits first will close the trade. This ensures discipline: winners are taken and losers cut automatically. (Tradier note: bracket orders might be day-only by default; since we want them active until triggered, use GTC where possible.)
Monitoring and Execution Flow: The system’s execution module should confirm order status via Tradier’s API (polling or using their streaming updates). Only consider a position “open” once the entry order is filled. If an order is partially filled or not filled within a certain time, the system could decide to adjust (e.g., if a limit order isn’t filled due to price change, maybe move the price or cancel if conditions changed).
Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Logic: Deciding the TP and SL levels can be based on strategy:
For premium-selling (credit) trades, a common approach is to take profit when ~50-80% of the max profit is realized, and stop-loss if the loss would exceed the original credit (or some multiple). E.g., if credit received = $100, take profit at $20 (keep $80), stop-loss at $200 (lose $100).
For debit trades (paying premium), maybe take profit at 100% gain, stop at 50% loss.
These parameters can be optimized or even dynamically set (perhaps based on volatility or time left). Initially, use sensible static rules and refine with experience. The important part is enforcing them via the API so that even if the system is offline, broker side orders protect the trade.
Rolling and Position Management: If conditions warrant, the system should roll or close positions proactively before TP/SL hits, especially as expiration or other triggers approach:
Time-Decay/Expiration Management: For short options positions approaching expiration week, if they are still open and not at profit target, decide whether to close or roll to avoid pin risk or sudden gamma swings. For example, 5 days before expiry, if a short strangle is slightly OTM and time decay is mostly earned, it might be wise to close early (lock in profit) rather than risk a last-minute move. Conversely, if the position is at a loss but you still believe in the strategy, rolling to next expiry may give more time for mean reversion. Rolling means simultaneously closing the current contract and opening a new one with later expiry (and possibly adjusting strikes). The Tradier API supports multi-leg orders, so a roll can be done as one OCO or two-step: close old, open new. The system should calculate the net credit/debit of the roll and ensure it aligns with strategy (ideally roll for a net credit if extending a short premium trade).
Volatility-Based Adjustments: If implied volatility drops significantly soon after selling premium, the position might reach a high profit quickly – close and take profits early (don’t wait for the last few cents of premium which come with more risk). If IV spikes (increasing risk for short options), consider cutting loss or tightening the position (e.g., convert a strangle to an iron condor by buying wings to cap risk).
Delta-Based Adjustments: If a trade that was delta-neutral becomes directional due to underlying movement (e.g., one leg of an iron condor goes deep ITM), the system could delta-hedge or roll that side. For instance, if a short call in a condor is ITM (delta nearing 1), you might roll it up or add an offsetting long call to reduce exposure. Another approach is stop-loss kicking in to exit – which might be simpler. Initially, implementing the bracket stop-loss covers many such cases; more advanced dynamic hedging can be added later.
Auto-Reinvestment of Gains: After closing a trade (either TP or SL), update the account’s available capital. The system should automatically use realized gains to increase the trading bankroll, effectively compounding growth. For example, if starting capital is $10k and it grows to $12k, subsequent trades can allocate position sizes based on $12k. Over time, this reinvestment yields exponential growth in the absence of drawdowns. This needs a position sizing function that ties into current equity (see risk control section for how position sizing is determined). Compounding will significantly boost returns over longer periods as profits continually feed into larger position sizes. (Ensure that risk limits scale accordingly so that percentage risk stays constant even as absolute capital grows.)
Execution Latency & Slippage: Tradier’s API is REST-based; executing orders will have some latency (~100-300ms). The system should be aware that between decision and execution, price can change. Mitigate this by possibly checking conditions right before sending order (to avoid entering on a spurious brief signal) and by using limit orders. Slippage – the difference between expected and actual fill price – can eat into returns. We accept small slippage as a cost of doing business, but we won’t execute strategies that are ultra high frequency or latency-sensitive. The chosen strategies (daily to weekly trades) are not so sensitive to a few cents difference. However, we still:
Use limit orders at sensible prices (mid or slightly beyond to get filled).
Avoid trading illiquid contracts where slippage could be large.
Possibly incorporate a slippage allowance in backtesting (e.g., subtract $0.05 per option trade) to account for it in performance expectations.
Confirmation & Logging: After each execution (entry or exit), log the details: timestamp, order ID, fill price, etc. The system should verify that an exit order indeed canceled its OCO counterpart. If, say, a stop-loss was hit, the take-profit order must be canceled – Tradier’s OCO should handle it, but double-check via API response.
Summary of Execution Workflow:
Signal -> decide trade -> place entry order (limit or market).
On fill confirmation -> place bracket exits (OTOCO with TP & SL).
Monitor position. If exit orders trigger, record outcome and free capital.
If certain conditions occur before exit (e.g., time to roll) -> execute adjustment (which may involve canceling existing exit orders and placing new ones for the rolled position).
Continuously enforce that at any time, every open position has a predefined exit path (either via bracket orders at broker or via strategy logic for manual adjustments).
By strictly following this execution plan, the system ensures each trade is managed from entry to exit with risk controls in place (profit targets, stop losses, ability to roll), and profits are reinvested systematically to compound growth.
6. Dynamic Risk Controls with Rolling Metrics (Sharpe, Drawdown, Ulcer)
Implement a layer of risk management that monitors the overall trading performance and adjusts the strategy to protect against downside risk. This goes beyond per-trade stops, looking at the portfolio/account level using rolling statistics:
Sharpe Ratio Monitoring: Calculate the strategy’s Sharpe ratio on a rolling basis (e.g., using daily returns over the last 3 months). The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return – essentially how much excess return we’re getting per unit of volatility. If the rolling Sharpe is too low or declining steadily, it indicates the strategy is performing poorly relative to risk. For instance, if Sharpe < 0.5 (or another chosen threshold), the system could scale down risk (trade smaller size) or temporarily halt new trades. A consistently low Sharpe suggests re-evaluating the model or strategy (the system might notify the user in such a case). The goal is to maintain a Sharpe that is healthy (e.g. > 1.0 ideally) for the live strategy.
Max Drawdown Limit: Track the maximum drawdown – the largest percentage drop from peak equity to trough. Set a hard limit on drawdown (for example, 20% of account). If this limit is hit, stop trading and alert the user. This is a capital preservation measure. The system can also employ tiered responses: at 10% drawdown, issue a warning and cut position sizes in half; at 20%, close all positions and put the system in sleep mode pending user intervention. Many successful systems include such cut-off rules to ensure survival through bad periods.
Ulcer Index for Pain Monitoring: Compute the Ulcer Index (UI) of the equity curve as an ongoing metric of “investor pain”. The Ulcer Index looks at both depth and duration of drawdowns. A low Ulcer Index means equity is near highs most of the time (small, short drawdowns); a high UI means prolonged drawdowns. Use the Ulcer Index to gauge if the strategy is experiencing unacceptably long slumps. For example, if UI exceeds a certain value (derived from, say, a 5% drawdown lasting many weeks), it might trigger a risk-off mode (no new trades until equity recovers to a certain level). The Ulcer Index is useful because it penalizes long-lasting drawdowns more than brief sharp ones – aligning with psychological risk (we want to avoid long periods of losses that could indicate structural issues).
Dynamic Position Sizing: Based on rolling volatility of equity or past performance, adjust how much capital is put at risk per trade. One approach: use a Kelly fraction or volatility parity. Simpler: if the strategy’s returns volatility increases (say std dev of daily returns doubled), reduce trade size to keep volatility of equity in check. Conversely, during very stable profitable periods, could cautiously scale up. We can incorporate rolling Sharpe into this: if Sharpe is high, it means returns are good relative to volatility – one might allow slightly larger positions; if Sharpe deteriorates, scale back. This dynamic sizing keeps the risk-adjusted metrics steadier.
Risk Budgeting by Greek/Exposure: The system should also limit aggregate exposures:
Total Delta: Make sure the sum of deltas of all open positions doesn’t exceed a certain portion of the account’s equivalent stock exposure (e.g., not more than ±1 delta per $ of equity for a fully invested directional bet, unless intentionally over-leveraging in a high-conviction moment). Essentially, avoid accidentally leveraging too high.
Total Vega: Limit exposure to volatility. For instance, if many short premium trades are open, the portfolio vega will be negative (short volatility). If absolute vega risk is high and a volatility spike could cause >X% loss, consider closing some positions or buying some options to hedge vega.
Correlations: If multiple positions on different underlyings are highly correlated (e.g., multiple tech stocks or multiple bullish bets), the system should recognize that effectively as one bigger bet. It might reduce the number of simultaneous highly-correlated trades to avoid concentration risk.
Day-of-Week and Time-based Risk Adjustments: The system can incorporate known patterns or avoid known risky periods. For example, if historically performance on Fridays has been poor (maybe due to unpredictable end-of-week moves or theta decay quirks), the system could choose to trade more cautiously or not at all on certain days. (This can be informed by the logging analysis in section 7 – e.g., if we find Tuesday trades lose money, stop trading Tuesdays.) Some traders avoid holding short options over weekends due to gap risk; the system can close or reduce positions on Friday if that’s a concern, or use that as part of risk rules.
Fail-Safe and Alerts: If any risk rule triggers (e.g., drawdown limit hit, or an unusual event like a huge overnight gap), the system should immediately attempt to flatten positions (if needed) and send an alert to the user. For flattening: execute market orders to close all open positions (this is drastic and only for emergency, but capital preservation is paramount). The user will be notified of what happened (e.g., “Max drawdown exceeded, all positions closed.”).
Review and Adaptation: The risk module should regularly (weekly or monthly) compile these metrics and report them, possibly adjusting internal parameters. E.g., if volatility of returns increased, it might lower the per-trade risk allowed automatically. The user can also be given a summary (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.) to understand the system’s performance quality. This is akin to having a risk officer always watching the strategy.
Note: All these controls aim to ensure the system remains stable and survives to exploit its edge. Many algorithmic strategies fail not because they don’t have an edge, but because they bet too big or ignore regime changes. By monitoring risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe) and drawdowns, the system will proactively dial down when things go wrong, avoiding catastrophic loss. For instance, a consistently declining Sharpe might indicate market regime shift where the model is no longer effective – better to stop and retrain than continue losing. The Ulcer Index focusing on drawdown depth/duration ensures we’re attentive to capital recovery times, not just instantaneous risk.
7. Trade Outcome Logging & Analytics
A comprehensive logging system will record all trade activities and outcomes. This serves two purposes: (1) Analytical feedback to refine strategies (what’s working, what isn’t), and (2) Transparency for the user (and developers) to review performance and decisions. Data Logged for Each Trade:
Trade Details: Timestamp of entry and exit, underlying ticker, strategy type (e.g. “bull put spread”, “long call”, “iron condor”), option specifics (expiration date, strikes, call/put).
Position Size: Contracts traded, premium collected or paid, margin used.
Entry Signal Info: The model’s signal values at entry (e.g., “Model score 0.82 (bullish)”, technical indicator snapshot, IV level, news sentiment). This helps later analyze if certain signals correlate with good trades.
Exit Reason: Was it a take-profit hit, stop-loss hit, manual roll, expiration, or manual intervention? Mark the outcome (e.g., “TP” for profit target, “SL” for stop, “Rolled”, “Expired Worthless”, etc.).
P/L Outcome: Profit or loss in absolute $ and as % of account (or % of premium). Also log duration of the trade (how many days held).
All these should be stored perhaps in a CSV or database row for each trade. Categorization for Analysis: Each trade log entry should include tags for the categories mentioned:
Day-of-Week: The entry day (and maybe exit day) of the trade. This allows grouping results by weekday. For example, we might find that trades opened on Monday have a higher success rate. Indeed, analysis of short-term options found that Monday was the most profitable day for 0DTE strategies while other days like Thursday/Friday were losing on average. Our logs will enable similar insights: if certain days systematically underperform, the system can adapt (reduce or avoid trading on those days).
DTE Bucket: Categorize how far from expiration the trade was initiated (e.g. 0-7 days = “Weekly”, 8-21 days = “Biweekly”, 22-60 = “Monthly”, >60 = “Longer-term”). This will let us analyze performance versus time-to-expiry. Perhaps the strategy might discover that trades with extremely short DTE (like 0-1 days) are too risky, whereas 7-14 day trades perform best – we can then focus on those. Example insight: A Reddit discussion suggests 30-45 DTE have lower risk than weekly options (lower gamma, better breakevens) – our logs could confirm if our system sees the same in practice, by comparing outcomes of weekly vs ~1-month trades.
Strategy Type: Label whether it was Directional (call/put or debit spread) vs Neutral (credit spread, iron condor, etc.). This is key to see which strategy is contributing most to profits. For instance, Option Alpha’s research on 0DTE trades showed neutral strategies (iron butterflies/condors) not only were most popular, but had the best performance (win rates ~67-70%) compared to directional spreads. We want to gather similar stats – maybe our neutral trades yield steady small profits, while directional trades are fewer but occasionally big wins/losses. If one category consistently underperforms, we can tweak the strategy allocation.
Market Regime (optional advanced tag): we could tag trades by volatility regime or trend regime (e.g., VIX level or SPY 50-day trend) to later see how strategy does in different market conditions. This is more advanced but could be helpful (e.g., strategy might do well in stable markets but poorly in high volatility – identifying that can lead to conditional rules like “don’t sell strangles when VIX > 30”).
Analytics and Reporting:
The system should periodically summarize the logs. Perhaps weekly, it can output a brief report: number of trades, win rate, average P/L, largest win/loss, etc., plus breakdowns: “Win rate by strategy: X% for credit spreads, Y% for directional”, “Performance by weekday: best on Wed, worst on Fri” etc., derived from the categorized data.
Implement functions to easily query the log data (could be as simple as reading a CSV into pandas for analysis, or if using a database, some SQL queries). The results of these analyses might be logged or even displayed on a dashboard for the user.
Use the insights to refine the strategy rules over time. This essentially closes the feedback loop: the AI can improve by learning from real outcomes (a form of reinforcement learning in a sense, though here we do it via analysis and adjusting rules or retraining model). For example, if logs show that trades held over weekends have worse outcomes (perhaps due to gap risk or time decay not compensating enough), the strategy might change to avoid weekend holds (close positions on Friday if possible). If news sentiment signals combined with technicals produce notably higher win rates (we can compare trades where sentiment was positive vs negative for bullish trades), it validates the use of sentiment data, and we might increase its weight in the model.
Logging Infrastructure: Implement this in a robust way – e.g., use Python’s logging to write trade events to a file or database. Ensure each trade has a unique ID for tracking. Possibly integrate with a Google Sheets or simple UI for convenience. But a local file (CSV/JSON) or an SQLite database may suffice initially.
Example Log Entry:
TradeID  Date      DOW  Underlying  Strat    Expiry  DTE  EntryPrice  ExitPrice  P/L($)  P/L(%)  Outcome  SignalConfidence  Notes  
0001     2025-08-01 Fri  AAPL        IronCondor Sep17  45   $2.10 credit  $0.50 debit  +$160   +80%   TP hit   0.55 (neutral)   "IV high, sold 150C/140P condor"
0002     2025-08-03 Mon  TSLA        BullPutSpr Aug20  17   $5.00 credit  $8.00 debit  -$300   -60%   SL hit   0.78 (bullish)   "Uptrend expected, but stock fell on news"
This shows an iron condor on AAPL opened Friday, 45 DTE, closed for 80% of max profit, vs a bull put spread on TSLA opened Monday 17 DTE that hit stop-loss due to unexpected news. We see signal confidence was high on TSLA but news sentiment might have been negative (not captured in this snippet). Such data would later help answer: are Friday iron condors consistently profitable? Are our bullish signals on TSLA being overridden by negative news we should heed? By logging and analyzing in this manner, the system effectively learns from its own live trading experience, allowing continuous improvement and ensuring the user can audit and understand the system's behavior.
8. Milestone Alerts and Behavior (Account Value Doubles)
The system should recognize significant milestones in account growth and respond according to user-defined preferences, particularly when the account equity has doubled (100% gain from starting value):
Detection: Continuously track the account value (starting value vs current value). When current equity ≥ 2 * starting equity, that indicates the account has doubled. (Also consider intermediate milestones: e.g. +50%, +100%, etc., but the prompt specifically asks for the doubling event.)
User Notification: On hitting the milestone, immediately send a notification. This could be an email, SMS, or push notification through the mobile app/PWA. The message might read: “Congratulations! The trading account has doubled from $X to $Y.” This alerts the user that the system achieved a major performance goal.
Automated Response Options: Provide a configurable setting for what the system should do upon doubling (the user can decide this beforehand in the system config):
Pause Trading: The conservative choice – the system stops initiating new trades once the current positions are closed. It can either close all existing positions immediately to lock in the doubled gains, or at least refrain from opening any new positions. Essentially, it goes into a safe mode waiting for user input. This allows the user to rebalance or withdraw profits without further risk from the system.
Continue Trading with Scaling: The aggressive choice – keep trading but possibly scale up position size now that capital is larger (or scale down to protect gains). There are a few interpretations:
The system could reset its baseline – e.g., treat the doubled amount as the new 100% and continue normally (compounding further).
Or it could intentionally halve risk per trade so that the originally risked capital is still what's at stake, thereby locking in the extra gains (this is like taking profits off the table mentally).
Alternatively, the user might choose to withdraw some portion of profits manually (outside system scope) after being notified.
Tiered Scaling: Some may choose an approach like: after doubling, only trade with half the capital and keep half in reserve, to ensure no matter what the system does, you won't go below the original principal. The system could support such configurations (e.g., user sets that at milestone, system should only allocate X% of equity going forward).
Implementation: In practical terms, once the milestone is reached, a flag in the system state could be set (e.g., reached_double = True). The trading loop checks this flag before initiating new trades. If pausing is desired, it simply won’t execute new trades (and possibly cancel any pending orders). If scaling down is desired, it will apply a factor (like 0.5) to all position sizes going forward. The user can be presented with these choices in advance (perhaps a setting in a config file or via an API endpoint to set the preference).
Psychological/Strategic Rationale: Doubling an account is a significant achievement, but it can also precede periods of drawdown if one becomes overconfident. By notifying the user and giving an option to pause or change strategy, the system promotes good risk management. For example, a user might decide to withdraw the original capital, leaving “house money” to trade – the system could then continue with the profits. Or the user might instruct the system to become more conservative to protect the gains. This flexibility is important for real-world trading scenarios, where after large gains, a prudent trader reassesses risk tolerance.
Adaptability: This feature can be generalized to other milestones or events (like after a losing streak of X%, or reaching a certain dollar threshold), but for now, the double event is highlighted.
The user should ultimately remain in control of such major decisions. The system’s role is to detect and inform, and execute the pre-set plan (pause or continue) securely. All milestone events and subsequent actions should be clearly logged and communicated (“Account doubled on 2025-09-01, trading paused as per settings.”).
9. Secure Access and Owner-Only Control (Authentication & Mobile Access)
Security and access control are critical since this system interfaces with a brokerage account and executes trades. Only the owner (or explicitly authorized users) should be able to control it or view sensitive information. Implement the following:
Authentication: Protect the system’s control interface (API and/or web UI) with strong authentication. Use token-based authentication for the FastAPI endpoints. For instance, require a JWT token or API key on every request to the FastAPI endpoints. This can be implemented in FastAPI by using dependency that checks a token against an environment variable or a simple auth database. Even a hard-coded API key stored in an env var that the user must provide in headers is acceptable for a single-user scenario.
Alternatively, integrate with OAuth2.0 flows. But since this system is personal, a simpler approach is fine: e.g., an Authorization: Bearer <token> header that the backend verifies. The token itself could be stored/configured by the user.
If a UI is built, ensure a login screen or token entry is required. Do not expose any controls without auth. This prevents others from accidentally or maliciously accessing the trading bot.
The Tradier API keys and Alpha Vantage API keys should be kept secure (environment variables or a secure config file). Never expose them in client-side code. The server should be the only place these keys reside, and the server must be secured.
Authorization: All critical actions (like starting/stopping trading, changing risk limits, executing a manual trade override) should only be allowed for the authenticated owner account. If you plan to extend to multi-user (like a SaaS), you’d have user roles, but for now one owner user with full rights is assumed.
Encryption & Safety: Use HTTPS for any web interface. If self-hosting, get TLS certificates. Data at rest (like logs) aren’t extremely sensitive (mostly performance data), but API keys are – ensure config files with keys aren’t world-readable if on a server. Possibly use encryption for stored credentials or integrate with a cloud secret manager if needed.
Mobile Access via API/PWA: Develop a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) or mobile-friendly web dashboard so the user can monitor and control the system on the go. This front-end will interact with the FastAPI backend through secure API calls:
The dashboard can display key information: current account balance, current open positions (with details like strikes, P/L so far), recent trade log summaries, and performance metrics (perhaps the latest Sharpe, drawdown, etc.).
It should also relay notifications. E.g., if the account doubled or a large loss occurred, a push notification can be sent. Since PWAs can use web push or one could integrate with a notification service (or simply send an email/text using an email API or SMS gateway when certain events happen).
Provide control toggles/buttons: e.g., “Pause Trading” (which sets a pause flag in the backend to stop new trades), “Resume Trading”, and maybe options to adjust parameters (like risk level, etc.) if needed.
Because it’s a PWA, the user can "install" it on their phone and get quick access, almost like a native app.
User Management Example: (Ref: Alpaca's guide for building brokerage backend) They used FastAPI with Amazon Cognito for user authentication in a multi-user environment
alpaca.markets
. In our single-user case, Cognito is overkill, but we note that using FastAPI’s OAuth2PasswordBearer or a similar scheme could be done to generate tokens for the owner. The core idea is to ensure the interface is not open to the public without a secret.
Session Security: If the interface allows executing any trade commands manually (maybe the owner can input a ticker to open a position manually), double-check those inputs and require confirmation – but since the idea is mostly automated, manual trade entry might not be needed.
Audit: Every command issued via the UI or API that affects trading should be logged (with user, time, action), so the owner can later see a history of actions (useful for debugging “did I accidentally pause it?” etc.).
In short, treat this trading system like a sensitive service: secure it by requiring authentication, expose minimal attack surface, and give the owner a convenient yet secure way to keep tabs on it. That way, only the owner can monitor status and intervene, whether from a desktop or mobile device, and no one else can start/stop or alter the trading activity.
10. Modular, Testable, Production-Ready Design (FastAPI & Realistic Assumptions)
Finally, ensure the entire system is designed in a modular and production-ready manner, following best practices, so it can be maintained and scaled. Key points:
Project Structure: Organize the code with clear separation of concerns. For example, a possible Python project layout:
data_feed.py (functions or class for fetching data from Alpha Vantage, storing/cache).
model.py (class for ML model handling: training, loading, predicting).
strategy.py (functions to decide on strategy and strikes given a signal).
execution.py (functions for interacting with Tradier API: place order, check status, manage OCO brackets).
risk.py (functions for risk checks like compute Sharpe, monitor drawdown).
logger.py (for logging trades and maybe performance).
app.py or main.py (FastAPI initialization, defining API endpoints, and the background task loop that runs the trading cycle).
Using FastAPI, define an APIRouter for any routes (e.g., routes for admin commands or status) to keep main tidy. FastAPI is known for being high-performance and suitable for this kind of application
coinsbench.com
, and it will automatically create docs for the API which is a nice bonus for the owner to use.
Asynchronous Design: Wherever possible, use async I/O. For example, calling Alpha Vantage or Tradier HTTP APIs can be done with httpx or aiohttp asynchronously, allowing the FastAPI event loop to handle other tasks. The trading loop itself could be a long-running background task that wakes up at certain intervals (or triggers on data events) to make decisions. FastAPI’s startup event can be used to launch this background task when the server starts. This way, the FastAPI process handles both the API and the trading logic concurrently.
Testing: Each module should be testable:
Unit test the data feed by mocking API responses (e.g., feed in sample JSON from Alpha Vantage to ensure parser works).
Unit test the strategy logic by feeding sample model outputs and market data to see if it picks reasonable strikes.
For execution, use Tradier’s paper trading environment (they have a sandbox endpoint) to simulate order placements without real money. Write tests that actually execute a dummy trade in sandbox and verify the responses.
Risk logic can be tested with synthetic equity curves.
Use a stub for the model (or a trivial model) during integration testing to produce deterministic signals and simulate end-to-end behavior without needing actual market moves.
Simulation/Backtesting: Before going live, the system could include a backtesting mode (though it might be outside scope to fully implement). However, at least test the logic on historical data offline: feed historical indicator values and see what trades the system would have taken, then evaluate performance. This can validate the integration of model and strategy selection. It’s not a requirement, but highly recommended for confidence.
Performance & Latency: The system should be designed to handle data and decisions in a timely manner, but since we are not doing ultra-HFT, standard practices suffice. Still:
Keep model and data in memory when needed (avoid re-downloading same data repeatedly within short spans).
Use caching for news sentiment if calling frequently (Alpha Vantage might have usage limits – perhaps 200 calls/min and 500/day for free tier). Plan data calls accordingly (maybe get news sentiment once a day per ticker unless something triggers a need for intraday update).
The trading frequency likely will be moderate (a few trades per week or day), so throughput isn’t a huge issue, but reliability is.
If running on cloud, ensure the server has stable connectivity (for API calls to broker) and uptime (consider using a process manager or container to keep it running, and logs piped to persistent storage).
Slippage & Latency Consideration (Production Realism): Recognize that in the real market, fills may not always happen at our desired price, or at all (order may miss if the market moves too fast). We include logic for that (adjust or cancel if not filled). Also, network latency could cause slight delays. However, because we plan positions typically with hours or days to play out, a few seconds of latency is not critical. Where it could matter is fast moves right after signal – e.g., if news breaks and triggers our model, by the time we trade, price moved. This is an unavoidable aspect of trading – we mitigate by using limit orders (so we don’t get a much worse price than expected). We won’t engage in strategies that assume we can always trade at exact last price. We might also include a parameter like “if price moved more than X since signal, re-evaluate before trading” as a safety. This is part of making assumptions realistic so the strategy won’t break in live conditions.
External Libraries and Integrations: We’ll use proven libraries: pandas for data manipulation, numpy for calculations, xgboost/lightgbm for ML, requests/httpx for API calls, FastAPI for the server, etc. If needed, use ta-lib or pandas_ta for technical indicators (or rely on Alpha Vantage’s calculations). Ensure these dependencies are listed in requirements and the environment is properly set up for them.
Deployment: Containerize the app (Docker) with all dependencies for portability. In production, run it on a secure server (possibly with environment variables for keys). The FastAPI app (with Uvicorn) will serve both the web interface and perform trading tasks. Possibly set up a reverse proxy (NGINX) with HTTPS if hosting a web UI. Also plan for failures: if the process crashes, use something like Docker restart policies or a supervisor to bring it back up. Ideally, trades have bracket orders at broker, so even if our system goes down, stops/profits are handled – this is an important safety design we included. On reboot, the system should reconstruct state by fetching current positions from Tradier (via API)
documentation.tradier.com
, so it knows what’s open and can resume tracking (and re-establish any missing stops).
Scalability: If in future we manage multiple accounts or more frequent trading, the architecture (with FastAPI and modular services) will allow scaling horizontally (more instances) or splitting components (e.g., a separate service for data & model and one for execution). But for one account, one server process is enough. Performance of FastAPI is high (on par with NodeJS in many cases)
coinsbench.com
, so it can easily handle our needs.
In sum, the system will be engineered like a production-grade trading platform in miniature: modular code, thorough testing, careful handling of real-world conditions (latency, errors, slippage), security for credentials and access, and the ability to run continuously and recover from issues. By following these guidelines, the resulting implementation will not be a brittle script, but a robust service ready for live trading.
Claude Code Prompt (Full Instructions for Implementation)
Bringing it all together, here is the complete prompt that we would give to Claude Code (the AI coding assistant) to create this system. This prompt includes all the requirements and guidelines above, ensuring the AI has the necessary detail to generate a Python/FastAPI implementation that integrates data, modeling, trading, and risk management:
You are an expert trading system developer. 

**Task:** Develop an **end-to-end options trading system** (Python code) that uses technical and sentiment data to generate trading signals, then executes options trades via Tradier API, with strict risk controls. The system will run as a FastAPI web application (for monitoring/control) with a background trading loop. It is for a **single user (owner)** and should be secure and production-ready.

**Requirements Detail:**

1. **Options-Only Trading:** All trades involve options (no stock or ETF trades). The system should be able to handle common option strategies (single-leg and multi-leg). Focus on equity options (stocks or ETFs underlying) for implementation. Ensure capability to fetch option chains and place option orders through Tradier’s API. No direct buying/selling of underlying shares.

2. **Data Sources:** 
   - Integrate **technical indicators** for underlying assets. Use Alpha Vantage API (or alternative) to get historical price data and indicator values (RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.). These will be used as features for signals. If using Alpha Vantage, utilize the `function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY` for prices and `function=TECHNICAL_INDICATOR` for indicators like RSI, MACD, etc. (Alpha Vantage provides dozens of indicators).
   - Integrate **news sentiment** data via Alpha Vantage’s `NEWS_SENTIMENT` endpoint for the underlying symbols. Parse the sentiment scores (e.g., positive/negative sentiment, relevance) from the JSON response. This will be another feature input for trading decisions.
   - Optionally, incorporate option-specific data: implied volatility (IV) for the underlying (which can be derived or fetched via Tradier’s option chain with greeks), put/call open interest ratios, etc., if available.
   - Keep data updated. For example, poll technicals and sentiment each morning (or intraday if strategy requires). Store recent values for use in the model. Handle API rate limits (Alpha Vantage is 5 calls/minute for free accounts – maybe stagger indicator requests or cache results).

3. **Signal Generation with ML (XGBoost/LightGBM):**
   - Use an XGBoost or LightGBM model to predict the market/strategy outcome. Define the target as either direction (up/down) or probability of profit for a certain strategy – design choice: a reasonable target is short-term price movement of the underlying (which then informs a directional or neutral stance).
   - **Features:** include technical indicators (recent values, possibly normalized), news sentiment scores (e.g., an aggregated sentiment in last 24h for the stock), and potentially historical option volatility metrics. For example: RSI(14), MACD(12,26) histogram, 5-day price return, current IV percentile, and news_sentiment_score.
   - Train the model on historical data (this can be done offline beforehand and the model saved, or the system can have an initial training routine). Ensure to avoid lookahead bias when preparing training data (align features with outcome correctly in time).
   - Use the model to generate a **signal** each day (or each decision point). This could be a binary signal (e.g. 1 = bullish, 0 = bearish) or a confidence score. For instance, model predicts 0.8 probability stock will rise > +1% in next 5 days -> interpret as bullish signal.
   - The code should load the trained model (from a file, e.g. XGBoost `.json` or LightGBM model file) at startup. If no pre-trained model is provided, allow a training mode (but for production assume we have a trained model to use).
   - Option: incorporate model explainability for logging (not required, but could use feature_importances_ to log which factors are driving decisions, for debugging).

4. **Strategy & Option Selection:**
   - Based on the model signal, choose an appropriate **options trading strategy** and specific option contracts:
     - If **bullish** signal: strategies include selling cash-secured puts or bull put credit spread (to earn premium with bullish bias), buying call options or call debit spreads (for directional upside). Decide which based on factors like IV: if IV is high, prefer selling premium (put spreads); if IV low, buying calls/spreads can be better.
     - If **bearish** signal: similarly, could buy puts or put spreads, or sell call credit spreads.
     - If **neutral/uncertain** signal but perhaps expecting low volatility: consider strategies like iron condors or short strangles (delta-neutral premium selling).
     - Ensure strategies chosen **balance delta and premium**: e.g., an iron condor should be roughly delta-neutral, a bull put spread will have positive delta but limited risk.
   - Limit to **weekly and monthly options**: i.e., choose either an expiration about 1 week out or the next monthly expiration (around 30 days out). This satisfies the requirement of focusing on weekly/monthly option chains. The logic can be: if signal is short-term (e.g., expecting move within days), use the nearest weekly expiration; if more medium-term or if weekly has too little premium, use the monthly.
   - **Option Chain Data:** Use Tradier’s **Get Option Chains** API to retrieve strikes for the chosen expiration. The response includes Greeks and IV for each option (if `greeks=true` is set). Use this data to pick strikes:
     - For spreads: pick strikes such that the short option has ~0.3 delta (for a reasonable balance of probability and premium) or based on a desired risk/reward. For example, a bull put spread: sell put at 0.3 delta, buy put maybe 5 strikes lower.
     - For iron condors: sell call and put at ~0.2 delta, buy wings ~5-10 strikes beyond.
     - For single options: maybe choose slightly ITM or ATM for higher delta if directional.
   - **Sizing:** Calculate how many contracts to trade based on account size and risk per trade. For instance, risk no more than 2% of account on any single trade’s worst-case loss. If account $10000, and a spread has max loss $200 per contract, you could trade 1 contract ($200 risk ~2%). For naked positions (like short strangle), define a notional risk (e.g., stop-loss or margin requirement) and size accordingly. Position sizing is crucial for risk management.
   - **Check delta exposure:** After selecting, compute net delta of the position (from option deltas * contracts). Ensure it aligns with strategy intent (e.g., bullish trade yields net positive delta). If it overshoots, adjust contracts or strikes.
   - This component essentially translates the **model’s abstract prediction** into a concrete trade with defined risk/reward.

5. **Execution via Tradier API:** 
   - Use the Tradier **Brokerage API** to place and manage trades. Prior to live trading, the code should be configurable to use Tradier’s **sandbox environment** for testing (paper trading) versus production.
   - **Order Placement:** Build functions to place different types of orders:
     - Single-leg orders (e.g., buy a call, sell a put) – use `/v1/accounts/{account_id}/orders` with class=option and option_symbol for the contract.
     - Multi-leg orders (spreads, iron condors) – Tradier supports `/v1/accounts/{id}/orders` with `class=multileg` or `combo` orders. Alternatively, place legs separately but preferably use one order to avoid leg risk. 
   - **Take-Profit/Stop-Loss:** Immediately after entry, set up **exit orders**:
     - If Tradier supports **OTOCO** (one-triggers-one-cancels-other) orders, use it to place a primary entry order that on fill triggers two exit orders (profit target and stop loss) as an OCO pair. 
     - If not directly supported in one request, implement logic: after entry fill, place a **OCO order** with two legs – one sell (or buy-to-close) limit at profit target, one stop order at stop-loss level. Tradier’s API has endpoints for OCO and OTOCO orders.
   - **Profit/Stop Criteria:** Define these criteria clearly:
     - For credit trades (premium selling), profit target could be **50-80% of credit earned** (i.e., buy back when premium has dropped to 20-50% of original). Stop-loss could be when premium doubles (100% loss) or some multiple. 
     - For debit trades (purchases), profit target might be 50-100% gain, stop-loss ~50% of premium paid (to not lose more than half on one trade).
     - These ratios can be adjusted based on backtesting or user preference, but code them as defaults that can be tweaked via config.
   - **Rolling Mechanism:** Implement functions to **roll positions**:
     - If an option position is nearing expiration or hitting certain conditions (e.g., 5 days to expiry and still far OTM but not at profit target), the system can roll to a farther expiration. Use the API to simultaneously close current position and open a new one (can use `class=multileg` to do a roll spread, or do sequential – but multileg preferred to avoid legging risk).
     - Ensure that when rolling, the new position is similar (e.g., same strikes or adjusted strikes) and that we **carry over the stop-loss/profit-taking logic** (likely need to cancel old exits and set new ones for the new position).
     - Rolling might also be triggered by **volatility or delta** triggers as discussed (e.g., if short straddle starts going wrong on one side, roll that side out and up/down).
     - This logic can get complex, so start with a simple rule: *if an option is  > X% ITM or < Y DTE and still open, then roll to next weekly/monthly*. Keep a log of rolls to ensure we don’t roll indefinitely without realizing losses.
   - **Auto-Reinvestment:** After each trade closes (either via TP or SL or manual close), update the account balance and available buying power. The system should automatically **recalculate position sizes** for new trades based on the new balance (compounding). E.g., if the account grew, trade size in dollar terms can increase (keeping percentage risk constant). This way profits are reinvested for growth. (The code can query account balance via Tradier API `/v1/accounts/{id}/balances` after each trade to get up-to-date equity). 
   - **Execution Safety:** Use try/except around API calls, with retries for transient errors. If an order is rejected, log the reason (e.g., “insufficient buying power” or “market closed”) and handle gracefully (maybe adjust and retry, or abort that trade).
   - **Order Book and Slippage:** When placing limit orders, especially for multi-leg, consider using a price that has a high probability of fill but not too bad for P/L. Possibly start at mid-price and allow a range. Keep track of whether orders fill or not:
     - If an entry order does not fill within a certain time (say a few seconds for market hours), the system can decide to adjust (e.g., move limit a bit) or cancel if conditions changed.
     - We want to avoid chasing prices indefinitely; implement a reasonable strategy to fill or kill orders (maybe use a **fill-or-kill** or **immediate-or-cancel** flag for Tradier orders if available).
   - **Confirmation:** After execution, record the details (order fill price, etc.) in the log. If using OCO bracket, monitor that one of the exits gets hit and then cancel the other.
   - **Example Flow:** Model says bullish on AAPL -> choose bull put spread -> fetch chain, pick strikes -> place order to sell 1 contract spread at $1.00 credit -> once filled, immediately place OCO: buy spread back at $0.20 (tp) or $2.00 (sl) -> monitor until one fills or expiration -> if TP filled, great (log profit); if SL filled, log loss; if near expiration and neither hit, maybe manually close at market on last day to avoid exercise.

6. **Risk Management – Rolling Equity Metrics:**  
   Implement global risk controls using metrics updated in real-time:
   - **Equity Curve Tracking:** Maintain a record of daily account value (mark-to-market). From this, compute metrics:
     - **Rolling Sharpe Ratio:** Compute over last 30 days of daily returns (or since start if less). If Sharpe falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 0 or becomes negative, or below 0.5), that indicates poor risk-adjusted performance. The system can respond by reducing trade size (e.g., cut positions to half until Sharpe recovers) or even halting trading (no new positions) until performance improves. This prevents churning in a bad regime.
     - **Max Drawdown:** Continuously update max peak and current drawdown. If drawdown exceeds, say, 20%, trigger an emergency protocol: halt all new trades and possibly close open trades to stop the bleeding. This is a “circuit breaker”. Less dramatically, at 10% drawdown, perhaps issue a warning (to log or user) and cut position sizes. The idea is to **never let losses get out of control** beyond the user’s tolerance.
     - **Ulcer Index:** Calculate the Ulcer Index over the rolling equity curve to measure **downside volatility**. If it starts rising significantly, it means the account is in a prolonged drawdown. Use this as a signal to be risk-averse. For example, if Ulcer Index goes above a certain value corresponding to an uncomfortable drawdown length, temporarily switch strategy to very conservative (or pause).
   - **Position Limit Controls:** Enforce limits like:
     - Maximum number of open positions at once (to prevent over-diversification or too much to manage).
     - Maximum total exposure: e.g., not more than 50% of account in margin at any time, or if using portfolio margin, not exceed certain risk factor.
     - Limit on overlapping risk: e.g., avoid selling 5 highly correlated put spreads that together can tank the account if the sector drops – the risk module could detect correlation (like all trades on tech stocks) and suggest or enforce fewer simultaneous similar trades.
   - **Day/Time Filters:** Optionally include risk-based time filters: e.g., avoid trading during earnings announcements for underlying (we can get an earnings calendar via Alpha Vantage or other means and skip those days due to unpredictability). Or avoid initiating new trades on very high-volatility days (VIX spike above threshold) – unless that *is* part of strategy (selling premium when high).
   - **Kill Switch:** Provide a manual and automatic kill switch. Manual – user can send a “STOP” command (via API or UI) to immediately close all positions and pause (for whatever reason, like they see market crashing). Automatic – triggers like extreme market moves (circuit-breaker events) could cause the system to flatten positions. Tradier offers market status; also one can monitor S&P futures for limit-down scenarios. If something crazy happens (like market -7% in a day), better to step aside. This is part of being production-ready for extreme events.
   - The risk management should run on every cycle (e.g., end of day or after each trade) to update metrics and enforce rules. If any rule kicks in, log it and ensure the trading loop knows (e.g., set a flag `trading_paused_due_to_risk = True` which the trading logic checks).

7. **Trade Evaluation & Logging (By Day, DTE, Strategy):**
   - Maintain a **trade log** (persistent, e.g., a CSV file or database table). Each trade record should include:
     - Timestamp of entry and exit, underlying, strategy type (a label like "BullPutSpread", "LongCall", "IronCondor"), quantities, entry price/premium, exit price, profit/loss, and duration held.
     - Also store **day-of-week** of entry, and DTE (days to expiration) of the options at entry, and news sentiment at entry, etc.
   - This data will be used to analyze performance by categories:
     - **Day-of-Week**: e.g., see if Monday trades perform better than Friday trades. There is evidence that certain option strategies (like 0DTE) have day-of-week effects. The system should compute stats by weekday (win rate, avg P/L) after enough trades and adapt if needed (e.g., avoid days that consistently underperform).
     - **DTE Buckets**: Compare outcomes of weekly trades vs monthly trades. It may turn out one is superior. For instance, perhaps trades with ~30 DTE have a higher success rate as some suggest. Adjust strategy focus to the more profitable timeframe.
     - **Strategy Type**: Track performance of different strategy types (spreads vs straddles vs long options). If, say, credit spreads are yielding steady profits but long calls are mostly losing (maybe due to IV underestimation), the system can decide to allocate more to spreads. Option Alpha’s research found neutral strategies had highest win rates for 0DTE – we should verify what works in our case through logged data.
     - **Other**: also log **model signal values** for each trade (like model confidence) to see if higher confidence trades do better (if yes, maybe we only take high-confidence signals going forward).
   - Provide a mechanism (maybe a FastAPI endpoint or a periodic log output) to summarize these stats. The user should be able to see a report like: *“Last 50 trades: overall win rate 65%, avg return per trade 1.2%. By strategy: credit spreads 75% win, avg +$50; long calls 40% win, avg -$20. By day: Mon/Tue good, Thu bad. By DTE: <=7 days trades had more volatility in outcomes than 30 DTE trades.”* This information could guide modifications to rules.
   - The logging and analysis ensure the system **learns from experience**. This is crucial for a production system – it shouldn’t blindly stick to initial parameters if real data shows a different optimal path. The design should allow incorporating these findings (maybe not fully automated optimization, but at least flagging to developer/user).

8. **Notifications & Milestone Handling (Account Doubled):**
   - Implement a notification system for important events. The primary one requested: when **account value doubles** from its initial value.
     - Keep track of initial account balance (e.g., on start, fetch account balance and store as baseline).
     - On each update of balance/equity, check if it’s >= 2 * initial. If yes (and not already notified), trigger a **notification**.
   - **Notification Method:** Could be an email (using an SMTP library or an email-sending service API) or a push notification through the PWA (if using web push) or even SMS (via Twilio API) – depending on user setup. At least an email is straightforward to implement: e.g., use Python `smtplib` to send a preset email to user’s address (credentials for an email account would be needed).
   - The notification message for doubling might encourage the user to consider next steps (like pausing or scaling).
   - **Auto-Pause Option:** Provide an option such that *upon account doubling, the system **pauses trading*** (no new trades) until user manually resumes. This could be a user preference (e.g., a config flag `PAUSE_ON_DOUBLE = True`). If enabled, when double is reached, set a flag to stop taking new positions and possibly close open ones to lock in gains.
   - Alternatively, user might want to **scale up** after doubling (though that is inherently happening via compounding). Perhaps the intention could be: after doubling, withdraw original capital and trade with house money – but that’s outside the system’s scope (user action). The system could simply notify and pause, letting user decide.
   - Other milestones: The system could similarly notify on drawdown thresholds (e.g., “Account down 10% from peak”) or other conditions, to keep user informed. But ensure not to spam – limit important alerts.
   - Logging: record that account doubled and any actions taken (e.g., “PAUSED due to account doubling on date X, from $Y to $Z”).
   - Having this milestone handling adds a **human-in-the-loop checkpoint** which can be valuable – it’s a chance for the user to reassess and perhaps recalibrate the system (maybe retrain model with more data, etc., now that capital is larger).

9. **Security – Owner-Only Access & Authentication:**
   - Protect the system with **secure authentication**. Use FastAPI’s security features:
     - Implement an OAuth2 password flow or a simpler API key scheme for the FastAPI endpoints. For simplicity, we can use an API token approach: The user must provide a header `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` with a pre-shared token for any request. The token can be set in config. 
     - Alternatively, use FastAPI’s `OAuth2PasswordBearer` and have an in-memory username/password (since only one user). The client (PWA) would obtain a token by posting credentials, then use that token for subsequent calls.
   - Ensure that **without valid auth, no sensitive action or info is accessible**. This includes starting/stopping trading, viewing logs, or any endpoints that could leak data.
   - Use HTTPS for communication, especially if deploying the interface publicly. If deploying locally or VPN, at minimum ensure the firewall is in place.
   - Do **not hard-code secrets** in the code that gets sent to client. All API keys (Alpha Vantage, Tradier, etc.) should remain on server side. The PWA or client never needs those – it only talks to our server.
   - Provide an **auth mechanism for mobile** – since we likely are using the same token or credential for PWA, that is fine. Possibly integrate with device biometrics if building native app, but with PWA, stick to token auth.
   - Possibly integrate a second factor or at least a very strong token since this controls financial transactions.
   - Keep the Tradier **access token** safe – Tradier uses OAuth for their API; the system should securely store the refresh and access token (or the user’s API key if using that method). This could be in a config file that is `.gitignored` and encrypted at rest. 
   - If the system is running on a cloud server, follow best practices: no unnecessary ports open, use environment variables for secrets, etc.

   - **Mobile Access (PWA):** Develop a simple frontend (this can be a separate step, possibly using a lightweight JavaScript framework or just plain HTML/JS with fetch calls to FastAPI). The PWA should:
     - Allow user to **login** (if using auth).
     - Show **dashboard**: key stats like current balance, today’s P/L, open trades with their P/L, recent notifications (like “last trade closed +$50” or “account doubled!”).
     - Provide control toggles: e.g., a button to “Pause Trading” (which calls an authenticated endpoint to set a `paused=True` in the system), a “Resume Trading” button, maybe a “Close All Positions Now” emergency button.
     - Possibly allow user to adjust some settings like risk per trade or change the profit target percentage (advanced, could be implemented if needed via an endpoint that updates config).
     - Show logs or recent trades in a readable format for transparency.
     - The PWA should be responsive (usable on phone). It can use caching to work offline for viewing last data, though trading actions would need connectivity.
   - Implement the necessary FastAPI endpoints to support the above:
     - `GET /status` – returns current status (balance, positions, maybe current signals).
     - `POST /pause` or `/resume` – to toggle the trading state.
     - `GET /trades` – returns trade history or last N trades.
     - Possibly `POST /close_all` – to liquidate everything (owner emergency action).
     - All protected by auth.
   - Test the security by attempting a request with wrong token etc., ensure it fails.

10. **Modularity & Testing in Code:**
    - Write clean, modular code. Each part (data, model, strategy, execution, risk, web API) should be somewhat independent so that it’s testable and upgradable.
    - Use classes or well-structured functions. For example, a `TradingBot` class that encapsulates state (like current account balance, open positions, etc.) with methods to perform actions (update_data, generate_signal, place_trade, check_risk, etc.) could be useful.
    - **Testing**: Develop unit tests for:
      - Data retrieval (use sample API responses saved to disk to simulate).
      - Signal generation (maybe test that given a certain synthetic input, the model outputs expected category).
      - Strategy selection (e.g., feed a bullish signal and high IV, ensure it chooses a credit spread not a debit spread, etc.).
      - Execution (this one can be tricky to test fully without hitting API – use Tradier’s sandbox and a dummy account with known positions).
      - Risk management logic (simulate equity series and ensure it triggers flags appropriately).
    - Also perform an **end-to-end paper trade test** in a sandbox:
      - e.g., override the model to output a deterministic signal (like always bullish), run the loop for a day in sandbox mode – see that it fetches data, decides on a trade, places it, and sets exits. You can manually move market (or simulate fills) to test TP/SL logic. 
      - Verify trade logs record properly.
    - Include proper **logging** in the code (using Python’s `logging` library). Log important events: “Placed order for XYZ”, “Trade 123 hit stop loss”, “Sharpe fell below threshold, pausing trading”. This will help in debugging and in understanding system actions after the fact.
    - Make configuration (API keys, thresholds like TP% or SL%, risk per trade, etc.) easily adjustable (maybe via a config file or environment variables or FastAPI endpoints). Document these in code comments or a README so the user knows how to tweak parameters.

**Deliverables:**
- A Python FastAPI application implementing the above. It should start a **background trader** (that periodically checks for new signals or manages trades) and expose endpoints for status/control.
- The code must be well-documented with comments, and avoid hard-coding values that should be configurable.
- Provide examples of how to use the API or interface (e.g., how to login to PWA, what endpoints are available for control).
- Ensure that the system can run 24/7 reliably (handle reconnecting to APIs if needed, etc.).

Focus on **robustness and clarity**: we prefer a maintainable correct system over a highly-optimized but opaque one. Consider real-world factors at each step (latency, partial fills, data errors) and handle exceptions so the system doesn’t crash unexpectedly. 

Now proceed to implement the system as specified. Start by setting up the FastAPI app structure, then implement data fetching, model loading, signal logic, trade execution, risk checks, logging, and the API endpoints. Integrate all components and ensure the system is ready for live (or paper) trading usage.
End of prompt. This prompt comprehensively instructs Claude Code to build the desired trading system, covering all 10 strategy points. It can be fed into Claude (in coding mode) to guide the generation of the code, which will directly integrate into a Python/FastAPI infrastructure as requested.

Prompt for Claude Code: End-to-End Options Trading System
Objective: Build an automated options trading system designed to maximize returns while managing risk, using technical indicators and news sentiment for signals. The system will generate trading signals with ML models and execute real trades via Tradier API, with robust risk controls and secure access.
1. Focus on Options-Only Trading
The system will trade exclusively in options contracts (calls, puts, spreads, combinations) – no direct stock or ETF trading. It should handle option chains for various underlying symbols and select appropriate contracts to trade. This focus allows strategies that profit from volatility and premium capture, using options' unique properties (e.g. leverage, time decay) for returns. The platform must support multi-leg option strategies (like spreads, straddles, iron condors) and manage options-specific events (e.g. expiration, assignment risk). Rationale: Options provide the flexibility to design trades with defined risk and tailored payoff profiles, which is essential for maximizing risk-adjusted returns. By excluding stocks/ETFs, we ensure the strategy concentrates on options Greeks and volatility dynamics.
2. Data Inputs – Technical Indicators & News Sentiment
Technical Indicators: Integrate a wide range of market technicals to inform trading signals. Use historical price data of underlying assets to compute indicators such as: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc. Alpha Vantage’s API offers over 50 technical indicators (e.g. RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA) that can be fetched programmatically. Additionally, track options-specific metrics like implied volatility (IV) and option greeks (delta, theta, vega) for the underlying’s option chain. The Tradier API can provide real-time option chain data with Greeks and IV (via ORATS integration), which the system should use to gauge market expectations and risk. News-Based Sentiment: Incorporate news sentiment analysis using Alpha Vantage’s news API. Pull news articles and sentiment scores for relevant ticker symbols (Alpha Vantage’s NEWS_SENTIMENT endpoint provides sentiment metrics on queried tickers). The system should analyze this data to quantify market sentiment (e.g. bullish, bearish, neutral) on the underlying. This can include sentiment scores or counts of positive/negative news. Rationale: News and social media can drive short-term price moves; by including sentiment, the strategy bridges technical analysis with market psychology. For example, a strongly negative news sentiment might warn against a bullish technical signal, or vice versa. Data Handling:
Schedule regular data updates (e.g. pull technicals and news sentiment daily or intraday). Use caching or local storage as needed to avoid API rate limits.
Ensure all data is time-synchronized (align indicators with the time of news sentiment).
If needed, use Alpha Vantage’s technical indicators API for simplicity, and combine with custom calculations for option metrics. For sentiment, parse the JSON news feed from Alpha Vantage and extract fields like overall sentiment score or label.
Example: For each underlying stock of interest, retrieve latest RSI, MACD, etc., and the latest news sentiment score (e.g. +0.5 bullish or -0.7 bearish). These form the feature inputs for the model in the next step.
3. Predictive Signal Generation with XGBoost/LightGBM
Leverage machine learning (gradient boosting models) to predict market moves or option strategy outcomes. The system will use XGBoost or LightGBM to generate trading signals based on the compiled features (technical indicators, sentiment, and possibly option-derived metrics):
Model Setup: Define the prediction target. For instance, predict the probability of the underlying stock rising or falling over the next period (e.g. next 5 days for a weekly options strategy), or predict the magnitude of price change, or even direct option strategy outcomes (profit/loss). A classification approach (buy signal vs. sell signal) or regression (expected return) could be used.
Features: Include a rich feature set: recent values of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.), trends or momentum indicators, volatility indices (VIX if relevant), option-implied metrics (current IV percentile), and the news sentiment score. For example, features might be: RSI(14), MACD histogram, 5-day price momentum, implied volatility change, and sentiment score from news. Combining these can improve model accuracy by providing both market technical state and public sentiment context.
Training: Train the XGBoost/LightGBM model on historical data. Use a moving window backtest – e.g., train on the past N months, then test/predict on the next week, rolling forward – to simulate live usage and avoid lookahead bias. Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation or Bayesian tuning for maximum predictive power.
Signal Output: The model should output a signal strength or probability. For example, output could be a value from 0 to 1 where >0.5 indicates a bullish expectation and <0.5 bearish. Alternatively, output could be categories like “Strong Buy”, “Buy”, “Hold”, “Sell” depending on thresholds. This signal will directly inform what option trade to execute (e.g. a strong buy signal could trigger selling a bullish put spread or buying calls).
Ensemble and Multi-Model: Optionally, use an ensemble of models (one might predict direction, another predicts volatility). In a real system, multiple signals improve robustness, as noted by literature that real strategies often use multiple models and signals rather than one. For now, one boosting model combining all features is sufficient, but keep architecture flexible to add more models later (e.g. a separate LightGBM model to predict volatility changes which might inform vega exposure).
Speed and Efficiency: XGBoost/LightGBM are fast and can handle real-time inference easily. The model inference step should be well under a second. Ensure model loading and inference is done at system startup and then reused (avoid re-loading model for each tick).
Continuous Learning: The system can periodically retrain the model with new data (say weekly or monthly) to adapt to regime changes. This could be automated in a background process, ensuring the model stays up-to-date (but also implement safeguards to paper-test new model before fully deploying, to avoid model drift causing losses).
In summary, the ML model turns raw data into an actionable predictive signal. For example: “Model predicts a 70% chance the stock will rise >2% in the next 5 trading days.” This would cue the system to initiate a bullish options strategy.
4. Strategy Selection – Weekly/Monthly Options, Delta Exposure & Premium Capture
Using the model’s signals, the system must choose which options to trade and how to structure the position. Key considerations:
Signal Interpretation: If the ML signal is strongly bullish (high probability of upward move), deploy a bullish strategy; if bearish, a bearish strategy; if neutral or low-confidence, consider a market-neutral income strategy. The magnitude of the signal confidence can determine aggressiveness (e.g. very strong signal => closer to the money options or larger position size).
Option Chain Analysis: Fetch the current option chain for the target expiration(s) from Tradier (which provides quotes, greeks, IV for each strike). The system should filter the chain for desired expiration dates – typically weekly options (expiring within ~7 days) or monthly options (the standard third-Friday expiries, often 30-45 days out). These two will be primary focus, as per the strategy requirement.
Weekly vs. Monthly:
Weekly Options: Use for short-term opportunities and quick theta decay capture. Weekly options have higher theta (time decay) and gamma (sensitivity to underlying moves) – good for short, high-confidence plays. If the model expects a move or mean reversion within days, a weekly option or spread can yield fast profits.
Monthly Options: Use for strategies that need more time or to reduce risk. As many traders note, 30-45 DTE options offer a balance of premium and risk – more premium than weeklies, but less gamma risk and a longer window for the thesis to play out. For example, selling a 30 DTE credit spread gives a decent premium and time for adjustments if needed, with lower chance of sudden 0DTE-style swings.
Delta Exposure and Premium Capture:
The strategy should balance delta exposure (directional risk) with premium capture (income from selling options):
For directional trades (when model strongly bullish/bearish): Aim for a delta-tilted position. For example, if bullish: buy calls or bull call spreads, or sell puts (cash-secured put or bull put spread). Ensure total delta is positive (for bullish) or negative (for bearish) in line with conviction. A rough guideline could be using options with ~0.5 delta for outright calls/puts to mirror underlying moves, or combining multiple contracts to reach a target delta equivalent to, say, a certain % of account equity.
For neutral/income trades (model isn’t picking a strong direction, but we want to earn premium): Construct delta-neutral or delta-light positions that profit from time decay and volatility mean reversion. Classic approaches include short straddles/strangles or iron condors, which have an initial delta ≈ 0. For instance, sell a call and put around the current price (straddle) or with some OTM cushion (strangle), or an iron condor (sell put and call spreads). This yields premium that can be captured if the underlying stays in a range. The system must manage the risk (see execution layer for stop-loss on these unlimited-risk positions). The premium capture is maximized by selling options when IV is high and letting theta work in our favor.
Strike Selection: Use technical and volatility inputs to pick strikes:
If buying options (directional): Consider slightly in-the-money or at-the-money options for a balance of delta and cost, unless it’s a cheap out-of-the-money lottery ticket scenario. For spreads, maybe buy ATM and sell a further OTM to finance.
If selling options (premium capture): Aim for strikes with a reasonable probability of expiring worthless. For example, sell options with delta around 0.15–0.30 (roughly 15-30% chance ITM at expiration). This aligns with common premium-selling practice where you win ~70-85% of the time but keep limited gains. Use model volatility forecasts to perhaps adjust this – e.g., if expecting low volatility, you can sell closer strikes for more premium.
Always check open interest and spreads – ensure strikes chosen have sufficient liquidity to enter/exit with minimal slippage.
Expiration Selection: Typically choose one expiration at a time for a given trade (either the nearest weekly or the next monthly). Over time the system can hold a portfolio of positions across expirations (like some positions expiring this week, some next month), but each triggered trade will decide on one expiration. The choice can depend on the signal’s time horizon (short-term signal => weekly, longer term view or smaller edge => monthly to allow time).
Examples:
Model says strong bullish, short-term news catalyst: Strategy = Bull Call Spread on the weekly expiration (buy call at ATM, sell call at +$5 OTM strike). Delta ≈ +0.3 to +0.5, limited risk, capitalize on quick move.
Model says mild bearish/neutral, high IV: Strategy = Iron Condor on monthly expiration (sell 30-DTE put and call ~15 delta, buy wings ~5 delta for protection). Delta ≈ 0 initially, theta positive, profiting if underlying stays range-bound.
Model says very bearish, volatility low: Strategy = Long Put or Bear Put Spread 4-6 weeks out (to give time for move). Buy slightly ITM put (delta ~ -0.6) and maybe sell a further OTM put to reduce cost.
Balancing Multiple Positions: If multiple signals (for different underlyings or if multiple strategies trigger), ensure overall portfolio delta isn’t overly skewed. For instance, if all signals say bullish, the system will naturally have a net long delta – that’s fine but monitor if it exceeds risk limits. We want the portfolio delta, gamma, vega in check relative to account size.
In summary, the system should algorithmically decide which option chain and strikes to trade such that the position’s Greeks align with the strategy: when seeking premium, keep delta neutral and collect theta; when directional, get the needed delta exposure while minding theta and vega. This careful selection provides the edge (e.g. selling overpriced options, or leveraging predicted moves) while managing risk (not too much directional exposure unless intended).
5. Trade Execution & Management via Tradier API
With a strategy and specific contracts chosen, the system must execute trades through the Tradier brokerage API. This involves placing orders, managing exits (take-profit/stop-loss), and handling any adjustments or rolls. Key aspects:
Placing Orders: Use Tradier’s order placement API to send orders for the selected option contracts. Tradier allows market, limit, stop, and multileg orders. Prefer limit orders for entry to control prices (especially important for options with wide spreads). For multi-leg strategies (spreads, iron condors), Tradier’s API supports combo orders to enter all legs simultaneously. The system should construct the order with the correct specifications: option symbol(s), quantity (number of contracts), side (buy/sell to open/close), order type and limit price, duration (day or GTC). If using limit orders, perhaps set at mid-price and allow some slippage tolerance.
Bracket Orders for TP/SL: Immediately after opening a position, submit exit orders to enforce profit-taking and stop-loss. Tradier supports advanced orders like OCO (one-cancels-other) and OTOCO (one-triggers-OCO). The system can utilize an OTOCO order: the initial trade execution triggers two linked orders – one is a take-profit limit order at a favorable price, and the other a stop-loss order at a worse price. These two are in OCO, so if one executes, the other cancels. This effectively creates a bracket around the position. For example, if we sold an iron condor for a $2.00 credit, we might place a take-profit limit to buy it back at $0.50 (75% profit) and a stop-loss order to buy back at $4.00 (100% loss) – whichever hits first will close the trade. This ensures discipline: winners are taken and losers cut automatically. (Tradier note: bracket orders might be day-only by default; since we want them active until triggered, use GTC where possible.)
Monitoring and Execution Flow: The system’s execution module should confirm order status via Tradier’s API (polling or using their streaming updates). Only consider a position “open” once the entry order is filled. If an order is partially filled or not filled within a certain time, the system could decide to adjust (e.g., if a limit order isn’t filled due to price change, maybe move the price or cancel if conditions changed).
Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Logic: Deciding the TP and SL levels can be based on strategy:
For premium-selling (credit) trades, a common approach is to take profit when ~50-80% of the max profit is realized, and stop-loss if the loss would exceed the original credit (or some multiple). E.g., if credit received = $100, take profit at $20 (keep $80), stop-loss at $200 (lose $100).
For debit trades (paying premium), maybe take profit at 100% gain, stop at 50% loss.
These parameters can be optimized or even dynamically set (perhaps based on volatility or time left). Initially, use sensible static rules and refine with experience. The important part is enforcing them via the API so that even if the system is offline, broker side orders protect the trade.
Rolling and Position Management: If conditions warrant, the system should roll or close positions proactively before TP/SL hits, especially as expiration or other triggers approach:
Time-Decay/Expiration Management: For short options positions approaching expiration week, if they are still open and not at profit target, decide whether to close or roll to avoid pin risk or sudden gamma swings. For example, 5 days before expiry, if a short strangle is slightly OTM and time decay is mostly earned, it might be wise to close early (lock in profit) rather than risk a last-minute move. Conversely, if the position is at a loss but you still believe in the strategy, rolling to next expiry may give more time for mean reversion. Rolling means simultaneously closing the current contract and opening a new one with later expiry (and possibly adjusting strikes). The Tradier API supports multi-leg orders, so a roll can be done as one OCO or two-step: close old, open new. The system should calculate the net credit/debit of the roll and ensure it aligns with strategy (ideally roll for a net credit if extending a short premium trade).
Volatility-Based Adjustments: If implied volatility drops significantly soon after selling premium, the position might reach a high profit quickly – close and take profits early (don’t wait for the last few cents of premium which come with more risk). If IV spikes (increasing risk for short options), consider cutting loss or tightening the position (e.g., convert a strangle to an iron condor by buying wings to cap risk).
Delta-Based Adjustments: If a trade that was delta-neutral becomes directional due to underlying movement (e.g., one leg of an iron condor goes deep ITM), the system could delta-hedge or roll that side. For instance, if a short call in a condor is ITM (delta nearing 1), you might roll it up or add an offsetting long call to reduce exposure. Another approach is stop-loss kicking in to exit – which might be simpler. Initially, implementing the bracket stop-loss covers many such cases; more advanced dynamic hedging can be added later.
Auto-Reinvestment of Gains: After closing a trade (either TP or SL), update the account’s available capital. The system should automatically use realized gains to increase the trading bankroll, effectively compounding growth. For example, if starting capital is $10k and it grows to $12k, subsequent trades can allocate position sizes based on $12k. Over time, this reinvestment yields exponential growth in the absence of drawdowns. This needs a position sizing function that ties into current equity (see risk control section for how position sizing is determined). Compounding will significantly boost returns over longer periods as profits continually feed into larger position sizes. (Ensure that risk limits scale accordingly so that percentage risk stays constant even as absolute capital grows.)
Execution Latency & Slippage: Tradier’s API is REST-based; executing orders will have some latency (~100-300ms). The system should be aware that between decision and execution, price can change. Mitigate this by possibly checking conditions right before sending order (to avoid entering on a spurious brief signal) and by using limit orders. Slippage – the difference between expected and actual fill price – can eat into returns. We accept small slippage as a cost of doing business, but we won’t execute strategies that are ultra high frequency or latency-sensitive. The chosen strategies (daily to weekly trades) are not so sensitive to a few cents difference. However, we still:
Use limit orders at sensible prices (mid or slightly beyond to get filled).
Avoid trading illiquid contracts where slippage could be large.
Possibly incorporate a slippage allowance in backtesting (e.g., subtract $0.05 per option trade) to account for it in performance expectations.
Confirmation & Logging: After each execution (entry or exit), log the details: timestamp, order ID, fill price, etc. The system should verify that an exit order indeed canceled its OCO counterpart. If, say, a stop-loss was hit, the take-profit order must be canceled – Tradier’s OCO should handle it, but double-check via API response.
Summary of Execution Workflow:
Signal -> decide trade -> place entry order (limit or market).
On fill confirmation -> place bracket exits (OTOCO with TP & SL).
Monitor position. If exit orders trigger, record outcome and free capital.
If certain conditions occur before exit (e.g., time to roll) -> execute adjustment (which may involve canceling existing exit orders and placing new ones for the rolled position).
Continuously enforce that at any time, every open position has a predefined exit path (either via bracket orders at broker or via strategy logic for manual adjustments).
By strictly following this execution plan, the system ensures each trade is managed from entry to exit with risk controls in place (profit targets, stop losses, ability to roll), and profits are reinvested systematically to compound growth.
6. Dynamic Risk Controls with Rolling Metrics (Sharpe, Drawdown, Ulcer)
Implement a layer of risk management that monitors the overall trading performance and adjusts the strategy to protect against downside risk. This goes beyond per-trade stops, looking at the portfolio/account level using rolling statistics:
Sharpe Ratio Monitoring: Calculate the strategy’s Sharpe ratio on a rolling basis (e.g., using daily returns over the last 3 months). The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return – essentially how much excess return we’re getting per unit of volatility. If the rolling Sharpe is too low or declining steadily, it indicates the strategy is performing poorly relative to risk. For instance, if Sharpe < 0.5 (or another chosen threshold), the system could scale down risk (trade smaller size) or temporarily halt new trades. A consistently low Sharpe suggests re-evaluating the model or strategy (the system might notify the user in such a case). The goal is to maintain a Sharpe that is healthy (e.g. > 1.0 ideally) for the live strategy.
Max Drawdown Limit: Track the maximum drawdown – the largest percentage drop from peak equity to trough. Set a hard limit on drawdown (for example, 20% of account). If this limit is hit, stop trading and alert the user. This is a capital preservation measure. The system can also employ tiered responses: at 10% drawdown, issue a warning and cut position sizes in half; at 20%, close all positions and put the system in sleep mode pending user intervention. Many successful systems include such cut-off rules to ensure survival through bad periods.
Ulcer Index for Pain Monitoring: Compute the Ulcer Index (UI) of the equity curve as an ongoing metric of “investor pain”. The Ulcer Index looks at both depth and duration of drawdowns. A low Ulcer Index means equity is near highs most of the time (small, short drawdowns); a high UI means prolonged drawdowns. Use the Ulcer Index to gauge if the strategy is experiencing unacceptably long slumps. For example, if UI exceeds a certain value (derived from, say, a 5% drawdown lasting many weeks), it might trigger a risk-off mode (no new trades until equity recovers to a certain level). The Ulcer Index is useful because it penalizes long-lasting drawdowns more than brief sharp ones – aligning with psychological risk (we want to avoid long periods of losses that could indicate structural issues).
Dynamic Position Sizing: Based on rolling volatility of equity or past performance, adjust how much capital is put at risk per trade. One approach: use a Kelly fraction or volatility parity. Simpler: if the strategy’s returns volatility increases (say std dev of daily returns doubled), reduce trade size to keep volatility of equity in check. Conversely, during very stable profitable periods, could cautiously scale up. We can incorporate rolling Sharpe into this: if Sharpe is high, it means returns are good relative to volatility – one might allow slightly larger positions; if Sharpe deteriorates, scale back. This dynamic sizing keeps the risk-adjusted metrics steadier.
Risk Budgeting by Greek/Exposure: The system should also limit aggregate exposures:
Total Delta: Make sure the sum of deltas of all open positions doesn’t exceed a certain portion of the account’s equivalent stock exposure (e.g., not more than ±1 delta per $ of equity for a fully invested directional bet, unless intentionally over-leveraging in a high-conviction moment). Essentially, avoid accidentally leveraging too high.
Total Vega: Limit exposure to volatility. For instance, if many short premium trades are open, the portfolio vega will be negative (short volatility). If absolute vega risk is high and a volatility spike could cause >X% loss, consider closing some positions or buying some options to hedge vega.
Correlations: If multiple positions on different underlyings are highly correlated (e.g., multiple tech stocks or multiple bullish bets), the system should recognize that effectively as one bigger bet. It might reduce the number of simultaneous highly-correlated trades to avoid concentration risk.
Day-of-Week and Time-based Risk Adjustments: The system can incorporate known patterns or avoid known risky periods. For example, if historically performance on Fridays has been poor (maybe due to unpredictable end-of-week moves or theta decay quirks), the system could choose to trade more cautiously or not at all on certain days. (This can be informed by the logging analysis in section 7 – e.g., if we find Tuesday trades lose money, stop trading Tuesdays.) Some traders avoid holding short options over weekends due to gap risk; the system can close or reduce positions on Friday if that’s a concern, or use that as part of risk rules.
Fail-Safe and Alerts: If any risk rule triggers (e.g., drawdown limit hit, or an unusual event like a huge overnight gap), the system should immediately attempt to flatten positions (if needed) and send an alert to the user. For flattening: execute market orders to close all open positions (this is drastic and only for emergency, but capital preservation is paramount). The user will be notified of what happened (e.g., “Max drawdown exceeded, all positions closed.”).
Review and Adaptation: The risk module should regularly (weekly or monthly) compile these metrics and report them, possibly adjusting internal parameters. E.g., if volatility of returns increased, it might lower the per-trade risk allowed automatically. The user can also be given a summary (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.) to understand the system’s performance quality. This is akin to having a risk officer always watching the strategy.
Note: All these controls aim to ensure the system remains stable and survives to exploit its edge. Many algorithmic strategies fail not because they don’t have an edge, but because they bet too big or ignore regime changes. By monitoring risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe) and drawdowns, the system will proactively dial down when things go wrong, avoiding catastrophic loss. For instance, a consistently declining Sharpe might indicate market regime shift where the model is no longer effective – better to stop and retrain than continue losing. The Ulcer Index focusing on drawdown depth/duration ensures we’re attentive to capital recovery times, not just instantaneous risk.
7. Trade Outcome Logging & Analytics
A comprehensive logging system will record all trade activities and outcomes. This serves two purposes: (1) Analytical feedback to refine strategies (what’s working, what isn’t), and (2) Transparency for the user (and developers) to review performance and decisions. Data Logged for Each Trade:
Trade Details: Timestamp of entry and exit, underlying ticker, strategy type (e.g. “bull put spread”, “long call”, “iron condor”), option specifics (expiration date, strikes, call/put).
Position Size: Contracts traded, premium collected or paid, margin used.
Entry Signal Info: The model’s signal values at entry (e.g., “Model score 0.82 (bullish)”, technical indicator snapshot, IV level, news sentiment). This helps later analyze if certain signals correlate with good trades.
Exit Reason: Was it a take-profit hit, stop-loss hit, manual roll, expiration, or manual intervention? Mark the outcome (e.g., “TP” for profit target, “SL” for stop, “Rolled”, “Expired Worthless”, etc.).
P/L Outcome: Profit or loss in absolute $ and as % of account (or % of premium). Also log duration of the trade (how many days held).
All these should be stored perhaps in a CSV or database row for each trade. Categorization for Analysis: Each trade log entry should include tags for the categories mentioned:
Day-of-Week: The entry day (and maybe exit day) of the trade. This allows grouping results by weekday. For example, we might find that trades opened on Monday have a higher success rate. Indeed, analysis of short-term options found that Monday was the most profitable day for 0DTE strategies while other days like Thursday/Friday were losing on average. Our logs will enable similar insights: if certain days systematically underperform, the system can adapt (reduce or avoid trading on those days).
DTE Bucket: Categorize how far from expiration the trade was initiated (e.g. 0-7 days = “Weekly”, 8-21 days = “Biweekly”, 22-60 = “Monthly”, >60 = “Longer-term”). This will let us analyze performance versus time-to-expiry. Perhaps the strategy might discover that trades with extremely short DTE (like 0-1 days) are too risky, whereas 7-14 day trades perform best – we can then focus on those. Example insight: A Reddit discussion suggests 30-45 DTE have lower risk than weekly options (lower gamma, better breakevens) – our logs could confirm if our system sees the same in practice, by comparing outcomes of weekly vs ~1-month trades.
Strategy Type: Label whether it was Directional (call/put or debit spread) vs Neutral (credit spread, iron condor, etc.). This is key to see which strategy is contributing most to profits. For instance, Option Alpha’s research on 0DTE trades showed neutral strategies (iron butterflies/condors) not only were most popular, but had the best performance (win rates ~67-70%) compared to directional spreads. We want to gather similar stats – maybe our neutral trades yield steady small profits, while directional trades are fewer but occasionally big wins/losses. If one category consistently underperforms, we can tweak the strategy allocation.
Market Regime (optional advanced tag): we could tag trades by volatility regime or trend regime (e.g., VIX level or SPY 50-day trend) to later see how strategy does in different market conditions. This is more advanced but could be helpful (e.g., strategy might do well in stable markets but poorly in high volatility – identifying that can lead to conditional rules like “don’t sell strangles when VIX > 30”).
Analytics and Reporting:
The system should periodically summarize the logs. Perhaps weekly, it can output a brief report: number of trades, win rate, average P/L, largest win/loss, etc., plus breakdowns: “Win rate by strategy: X% for credit spreads, Y% for directional”, “Performance by weekday: best on Wed, worst on Fri” etc., derived from the categorized data.
Implement functions to easily query the log data (could be as simple as reading a CSV into pandas for analysis, or if using a database, some SQL queries). The results of these analyses might be logged or even displayed on a dashboard for the user.
Use the insights to refine the strategy rules over time. This essentially closes the feedback loop: the AI can improve by learning from real outcomes (a form of reinforcement learning in a sense, though here we do it via analysis and adjusting rules or retraining model). For example, if logs show that trades held over weekends have worse outcomes (perhaps due to gap risk or time decay not compensating enough), the strategy might change to avoid weekend holds (close positions on Friday if possible). If news sentiment signals combined with technicals produce notably higher win rates (we can compare trades where sentiment was positive vs negative for bullish trades), it validates the use of sentiment data, and we might increase its weight in the model.
Logging Infrastructure: Implement this in a robust way – e.g., use Python’s logging to write trade events to a file or database. Ensure each trade has a unique ID for tracking. Possibly integrate with a Google Sheets or simple UI for convenience. But a local file (CSV/JSON) or an SQLite database may suffice initially.
Example Log Entry:
TradeID  Date      DOW  Underlying  Strat    Expiry  DTE  EntryPrice  ExitPrice  P/L($)  P/L(%)  Outcome  SignalConfidence  Notes  
0001     2025-08-01 Fri  AAPL        IronCondor Sep17  45   $2.10 credit  $0.50 debit  +$160   +80%   TP hit   0.55 (neutral)   "IV high, sold 150C/140P condor"
0002     2025-08-03 Mon  TSLA        BullPutSpr Aug20  17   $5.00 credit  $8.00 debit  -$300   -60%   SL hit   0.78 (bullish)   "Uptrend expected, but stock fell on news"
This shows an iron condor on AAPL opened Friday, 45 DTE, closed for 80% of max profit, vs a bull put spread on TSLA opened Monday 17 DTE that hit stop-loss due to unexpected news. We see signal confidence was high on TSLA but news sentiment might have been negative (not captured in this snippet). Such data would later help answer: are Friday iron condors consistently profitable? Are our bullish signals on TSLA being overridden by negative news we should heed? By logging and analyzing in this manner, the system effectively learns from its own live trading experience, allowing continuous improvement and ensuring the user can audit and understand the system's behavior.
8. Milestone Alerts and Behavior (Account Value Doubles)
The system should recognize significant milestones in account growth and respond according to user-defined preferences, particularly when the account equity has doubled (100% gain from starting value):
Detection: Continuously track the account value (starting value vs current value). When current equity ≥ 2 * starting equity, that indicates the account has doubled. (Also consider intermediate milestones: e.g. +50%, +100%, etc., but the prompt specifically asks for the doubling event.)
User Notification: On hitting the milestone, immediately send a notification. This could be an email, SMS, or push notification through the mobile app/PWA. The message might read: “Congratulations! The trading account has doubled from $X to $Y.” This alerts the user that the system achieved a major performance goal.
Automated Response Options: Provide a configurable setting for what the system should do upon doubling (the user can decide this beforehand in the system config):
Pause Trading: The conservative choice – the system stops initiating new trades once the current positions are closed. It can either close all existing positions immediately to lock in the doubled gains, or at least refrain from opening any new positions. Essentially, it goes into a safe mode waiting for user input. This allows the user to rebalance or withdraw profits without further risk from the system.
Continue Trading with Scaling: The aggressive choice – keep trading but possibly scale up position size now that capital is larger (or scale down to protect gains). There are a few interpretations:
The system could reset its baseline – e.g., treat the doubled amount as the new 100% and continue normally (compounding further).
Or it could intentionally halve risk per trade so that the originally risked capital is still what's at stake, thereby locking in the extra gains (this is like taking profits off the table mentally).
Alternatively, the user might choose to withdraw some portion of profits manually (outside system scope) after being notified.
Tiered Scaling: Some may choose an approach like: after doubling, only trade with half the capital and keep half in reserve, to ensure no matter what the system does, you won't go below the original principal. The system could support such configurations (e.g., user sets that at milestone, system should only allocate X% of equity going forward).
Implementation: In practical terms, once the milestone is reached, a flag in the system state could be set (e.g., reached_double = True). The trading loop checks this flag before initiating new trades. If pausing is desired, it simply won’t execute new trades (and possibly cancel any pending orders). If scaling down is desired, it will apply a factor (like 0.5) to all position sizes going forward. The user can be presented with these choices in advance (perhaps a setting in a config file or via an API endpoint to set the preference).
Psychological/Strategic Rationale: Doubling an account is a significant achievement, but it can also precede periods of drawdown if one becomes overconfident. By notifying the user and giving an option to pause or change strategy, the system promotes good risk management. For example, a user might decide to withdraw the original capital, leaving “house money” to trade – the system could then continue with the profits. Or the user might instruct the system to become more conservative to protect the gains. This flexibility is important for real-world trading scenarios, where after large gains, a prudent trader reassesses risk tolerance.
Adaptability: This feature can be generalized to other milestones or events (like after a losing streak of X%, or reaching a certain dollar threshold), but for now, the double event is highlighted.
The user should ultimately remain in control of such major decisions. The system’s role is to detect and inform, and execute the pre-set plan (pause or continue) securely. All milestone events and subsequent actions should be clearly logged and communicated (“Account doubled on 2025-09-01, trading paused as per settings.”).
9. Secure Access and Owner-Only Control (Authentication & Mobile Access)
Security and access control are critical since this system interfaces with a brokerage account and executes trades. Only the owner (or explicitly authorized users) should be able to control it or view sensitive information. Implement the following:
Authentication: Protect the system’s control interface (API and/or web UI) with strong authentication. Use token-based authentication for the FastAPI endpoints. For instance, require a JWT token or API key on every request to the FastAPI endpoints. This can be implemented in FastAPI by using dependency that checks a token against an environment variable or a simple auth database. Even a hard-coded API key stored in an env var that the user must provide in headers is acceptable for a single-user scenario.
Alternatively, integrate with OAuth2.0 flows. But since this system is personal, a simpler approach is fine: e.g., an Authorization: Bearer <token> header that the backend verifies. The token itself could be stored/configured by the user.
If a UI is built, ensure a login screen or token entry is required. Do not expose any controls without auth. This prevents others from accidentally or maliciously accessing the trading bot.
The Tradier API keys and Alpha Vantage API keys should be kept secure (environment variables or a secure config file). Never expose them in client-side code. The server should be the only place these keys reside, and the server must be secured.
Authorization: All critical actions (like starting/stopping trading, changing risk limits, executing a manual trade override) should only be allowed for the authenticated owner account. If you plan to extend to multi-user (like a SaaS), you’d have user roles, but for now one owner user with full rights is assumed.
Encryption & Safety: Use HTTPS for any web interface. If self-hosting, get TLS certificates. Data at rest (like logs) aren’t extremely sensitive (mostly performance data), but API keys are – ensure config files with keys aren’t world-readable if on a server. Possibly use encryption for stored credentials or integrate with a cloud secret manager if needed.
Mobile Access via API/PWA: Develop a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) or mobile-friendly web dashboard so the user can monitor and control the system on the go. This front-end will interact with the FastAPI backend through secure API calls:
The dashboard can display key information: current account balance, current open positions (with details like strikes, P/L so far), recent trade log summaries, and performance metrics (perhaps the latest Sharpe, drawdown, etc.).
It should also relay notifications. E.g., if the account doubled or a large loss occurred, a push notification can be sent. Since PWAs can use web push or one could integrate with a notification service (or simply send an email/text using an email API or SMS gateway when certain events happen).
Provide control toggles/buttons: e.g., “Pause Trading” (which sets a pause flag in the backend to stop new trades), “Resume Trading”, and maybe options to adjust parameters (like risk level, etc.) if needed.
Because it’s a PWA, the user can "install" it on their phone and get quick access, almost like a native app.
User Management Example: (Ref: Alpaca's guide for building brokerage backend) They used FastAPI with Amazon Cognito for user authentication in a multi-user environment
alpaca.markets
. In our single-user case, Cognito is overkill, but we note that using FastAPI’s OAuth2PasswordBearer or a similar scheme could be done to generate tokens for the owner. The core idea is to ensure the interface is not open to the public without a secret.
Session Security: If the interface allows executing any trade commands manually (maybe the owner can input a ticker to open a position manually), double-check those inputs and require confirmation – but since the idea is mostly automated, manual trade entry might not be needed.
Audit: Every command issued via the UI or API that affects trading should be logged (with user, time, action), so the owner can later see a history of actions (useful for debugging “did I accidentally pause it?” etc.).
In short, treat this trading system like a sensitive service: secure it by requiring authentication, expose minimal attack surface, and give the owner a convenient yet secure way to keep tabs on it. That way, only the owner can monitor status and intervene, whether from a desktop or mobile device, and no one else can start/stop or alter the trading activity.
10. Modular, Testable, Production-Ready Design (FastAPI & Realistic Assumptions)
Finally, ensure the entire system is designed in a modular and production-ready manner, following best practices, so it can be maintained and scaled. Key points:
Project Structure: Organize the code with clear separation of concerns. For example, a possible Python project layout:
data_feed.py (functions or class for fetching data from Alpha Vantage, storing/cache).
model.py (class for ML model handling: training, loading, predicting).
strategy.py (functions to decide on strategy and strikes given a signal).
execution.py (functions for interacting with Tradier API: place order, check status, manage OCO brackets).
risk.py (functions for risk checks like compute Sharpe, monitor drawdown).
logger.py (for logging trades and maybe performance).
app.py or main.py (FastAPI initialization, defining API endpoints, and the background task loop that runs the trading cycle).
Using FastAPI, define an APIRouter for any routes (e.g., routes for admin commands or status) to keep main tidy. FastAPI is known for being high-performance and suitable for this kind of application
coinsbench.com
, and it will automatically create docs for the API which is a nice bonus for the owner to use.
Asynchronous Design: Wherever possible, use async I/O. For example, calling Alpha Vantage or Tradier HTTP APIs can be done with httpx or aiohttp asynchronously, allowing the FastAPI event loop to handle other tasks. The trading loop itself could be a long-running background task that wakes up at certain intervals (or triggers on data events) to make decisions. FastAPI’s startup event can be used to launch this background task when the server starts. This way, the FastAPI process handles both the API and the trading logic concurrently.
Testing: Each module should be testable:
Unit test the data feed by mocking API responses (e.g., feed in sample JSON from Alpha Vantage to ensure parser works).
Unit test the strategy logic by feeding sample model outputs and market data to see if it picks reasonable strikes.
For execution, use Tradier’s paper trading environment (they have a sandbox endpoint) to simulate order placements without real money. Write tests that actually execute a dummy trade in sandbox and verify the responses.
Risk logic can be tested with synthetic equity curves.
Use a stub for the model (or a trivial model) during integration testing to produce deterministic signals and simulate end-to-end behavior without needing actual market moves.
Simulation/Backtesting: Before going live, the system could include a backtesting mode (though it might be outside scope to fully implement). However, at least test the logic on historical data offline: feed historical indicator values and see what trades the system would have taken, then evaluate performance. This can validate the integration of model and strategy selection. It’s not a requirement, but highly recommended for confidence.
Performance & Latency: The system should be designed to handle data and decisions in a timely manner, but since we are not doing ultra-HFT, standard practices suffice. Still:
Keep model and data in memory when needed (avoid re-downloading same data repeatedly within short spans).
Use caching for news sentiment if calling frequently (Alpha Vantage might have usage limits – perhaps 200 calls/min and 500/day for free tier). Plan data calls accordingly (maybe get news sentiment once a day per ticker unless something triggers a need for intraday update).
The trading frequency likely will be moderate (a few trades per week or day), so throughput isn’t a huge issue, but reliability is.
If running on cloud, ensure the server has stable connectivity (for API calls to broker) and uptime (consider using a process manager or container to keep it running, and logs piped to persistent storage).
Slippage & Latency Consideration (Production Realism): Recognize that in the real market, fills may not always happen at our desired price, or at all (order may miss if the market moves too fast). We include logic for that (adjust or cancel if not filled). Also, network latency could cause slight delays. However, because we plan positions typically with hours or days to play out, a few seconds of latency is not critical. Where it could matter is fast moves right after signal – e.g., if news breaks and triggers our model, by the time we trade, price moved. This is an unavoidable aspect of trading – we mitigate by using limit orders (so we don’t get a much worse price than expected). We won’t engage in strategies that assume we can always trade at exact last price. We might also include a parameter like “if price moved more than X since signal, re-evaluate before trading” as a safety. This is part of making assumptions realistic so the strategy won’t break in live conditions.
External Libraries and Integrations: We’ll use proven libraries: pandas for data manipulation, numpy for calculations, xgboost/lightgbm for ML, requests/httpx for API calls, FastAPI for the server, etc. If needed, use ta-lib or pandas_ta for technical indicators (or rely on Alpha Vantage’s calculations). Ensure these dependencies are listed in requirements and the environment is properly set up for them.
Deployment: Containerize the app (Docker) with all dependencies for portability. In production, run it on a secure server (possibly with environment variables for keys). The FastAPI app (with Uvicorn) will serve both the web interface and perform trading tasks. Possibly set up a reverse proxy (NGINX) with HTTPS if hosting a web UI. Also plan for failures: if the process crashes, use something like Docker restart policies or a supervisor to bring it back up. Ideally, trades have bracket orders at broker, so even if our system goes down, stops/profits are handled – this is an important safety design we included. On reboot, the system should reconstruct state by fetching current positions from Tradier (via API)
documentation.tradier.com
, so it knows what’s open and can resume tracking (and re-establish any missing stops).
Scalability: If in future we manage multiple accounts or more frequent trading, the architecture (with FastAPI and modular services) will allow scaling horizontally (more instances) or splitting components (e.g., a separate service for data & model and one for execution). But for one account, one server process is enough. Performance of FastAPI is high (on par with NodeJS in many cases)
coinsbench.com
, so it can easily handle our needs.
In sum, the system will be engineered like a production-grade trading platform in miniature: modular code, thorough testing, careful handling of real-world conditions (latency, errors, slippage), security for credentials and access, and the ability to run continuously and recover from issues. By following these guidelines, the resulting implementation will not be a brittle script, but a robust service ready for live trading.
Claude Code Prompt (Full Instructions for Implementation)
Bringing it all together, here is the complete prompt that we would give to Claude Code (the AI coding assistant) to create this system. This prompt includes all the requirements and guidelines above, ensuring the AI has the necessary detail to generate a Python/FastAPI implementation that integrates data, modeling, trading, and risk management:
You are an expert trading system developer. 

**Task:** Develop an **end-to-end options trading system** (Python code) that uses technical and sentiment data to generate trading signals, then executes options trades via Tradier API, with strict risk controls. The system will run as a FastAPI web application (for monitoring/control) with a background trading loop. It is for a **single user (owner)** and should be secure and production-ready.

**Requirements Detail:**

1. **Options-Only Trading:** All trades involve options (no stock or ETF trades). The system should be able to handle common option strategies (single-leg and multi-leg). Focus on equity options (stocks or ETFs underlying) for implementation. Ensure capability to fetch option chains and place option orders through Tradier’s API. No direct buying/selling of underlying shares.

2. **Data Sources:** 
   - Integrate **technical indicators** for underlying assets. Use Alpha Vantage API (or alternative) to get historical price data and indicator values (RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.). These will be used as features for signals. If using Alpha Vantage, utilize the `function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY` for prices and `function=TECHNICAL_INDICATOR` for indicators like RSI, MACD, etc. (Alpha Vantage provides dozens of indicators).
   - Integrate **news sentiment** data via Alpha Vantage’s `NEWS_SENTIMENT` endpoint for the underlying symbols. Parse the sentiment scores (e.g., positive/negative sentiment, relevance) from the JSON response. This will be another feature input for trading decisions.
   - Optionally, incorporate option-specific data: implied volatility (IV) for the underlying (which can be derived or fetched via Tradier’s option chain with greeks), put/call open interest ratios, etc., if available.
   - Keep data updated. For example, poll technicals and sentiment each morning (or intraday if strategy requires). Store recent values for use in the model. Handle API rate limits (Alpha Vantage is 5 calls/minute for free accounts – maybe stagger indicator requests or cache results).

3. **Signal Generation with ML (XGBoost/LightGBM):**
   - Use an XGBoost or LightGBM model to predict the market/strategy outcome. Define the target as either direction (up/down) or probability of profit for a certain strategy – design choice: a reasonable target is short-term price movement of the underlying (which then informs a directional or neutral stance).
   - **Features:** include technical indicators (recent values, possibly normalized), news sentiment scores (e.g., an aggregated sentiment in last 24h for the stock), and potentially historical option volatility metrics. For example: RSI(14), MACD(12,26) histogram, 5-day price return, current IV percentile, and news_sentiment_score.
   - Train the model on historical data (this can be done offline beforehand and the model saved, or the system can have an initial training routine). Ensure to avoid lookahead bias when preparing training data (align features with outcome correctly in time).
   - Use the model to generate a **signal** each day (or each decision point). This could be a binary signal (e.g. 1 = bullish, 0 = bearish) or a confidence score. For instance, model predicts 0.8 probability stock will rise > +1% in next 5 days -> interpret as bullish signal.
   - The code should load the trained model (from a file, e.g. XGBoost `.json` or LightGBM model file) at startup. If no pre-trained model is provided, allow a training mode (but for production assume we have a trained model to use).
   - Option: incorporate model explainability for logging (not required, but could use feature_importances_ to log which factors are driving decisions, for debugging).

4. **Strategy & Option Selection:**
   - Based on the model signal, choose an appropriate **options trading strategy** and specific option contracts:
     - If **bullish** signal: strategies include selling cash-secured puts or bull put credit spread (to earn premium with bullish bias), buying call options or call debit spreads (for directional upside). Decide which based on factors like IV: if IV is high, prefer selling premium (put spreads); if IV low, buying calls/spreads can be better.
     - If **bearish** signal: similarly, could buy puts or put spreads, or sell call credit spreads.
     - If **neutral/uncertain** signal but perhaps expecting low volatility: consider strategies like iron condors or short strangles (delta-neutral premium selling).
     - Ensure strategies chosen **balance delta and premium**: e.g., an iron condor should be roughly delta-neutral, a bull put spread will have positive delta but limited risk.
   - Limit to **weekly and monthly options**: i.e., choose either an expiration about 1 week out or the next monthly expiration (around 30 days out). This satisfies the requirement of focusing on weekly/monthly option chains. The logic can be: if signal is short-term (e.g., expecting move within days), use the nearest weekly expiration; if more medium-term or if weekly has too little premium, use the monthly.
   - **Option Chain Data:** Use Tradier’s **Get Option Chains** API to retrieve strikes for the chosen expiration. The response includes Greeks and IV for each option (if `greeks=true` is set). Use this data to pick strikes:
     - For spreads: pick strikes such that the short option has ~0.3 delta (for a reasonable balance of probability and premium) or based on a desired risk/reward. For example, a bull put spread: sell put at 0.3 delta, buy put maybe 5 strikes lower.
     - For iron condors: sell call and put at ~0.2 delta, buy wings ~5-10 strikes beyond.
     - For single options: maybe choose slightly ITM or ATM for higher delta if directional.
   - **Sizing:** Calculate how many contracts to trade based on account size and risk per trade. For instance, risk no more than 2% of account on any single trade’s worst-case loss. If account $10000, and a spread has max loss $200 per contract, you could trade 1 contract ($200 risk ~2%). For naked positions (like short strangle), define a notional risk (e.g., stop-loss or margin requirement) and size accordingly. Position sizing is crucial for risk management.
   - **Check delta exposure:** After selecting, compute net delta of the position (from option deltas * contracts). Ensure it aligns with strategy intent (e.g., bullish trade yields net positive delta). If it overshoots, adjust contracts or strikes.
   - This component essentially translates the **model’s abstract prediction** into a concrete trade with defined risk/reward.

5. **Execution via Tradier API:** 
   - Use the Tradier **Brokerage API** to place and manage trades. Prior to live trading, the code should be configurable to use Tradier’s **sandbox environment** for testing (paper trading) versus production.
   - **Order Placement:** Build functions to place different types of orders:
     - Single-leg orders (e.g., buy a call, sell a put) – use `/v1/accounts/{account_id}/orders` with class=option and option_symbol for the contract.
     - Multi-leg orders (spreads, iron condors) – Tradier supports `/v1/accounts/{id}/orders` with `class=multileg` or `combo` orders. Alternatively, place legs separately but preferably use one order to avoid leg risk. 
   - **Take-Profit/Stop-Loss:** Immediately after entry, set up **exit orders**:
     - If Tradier supports **OTOCO** (one-triggers-one-cancels-other) orders, use it to place a primary entry order that on fill triggers two exit orders (profit target and stop loss) as an OCO pair. 
     - If not directly supported in one request, implement logic: after entry fill, place a **OCO order** with two legs – one sell (or buy-to-close) limit at profit target, one stop order at stop-loss level. Tradier’s API has endpoints for OCO and OTOCO orders.
   - **Profit/Stop Criteria:** Define these criteria clearly:
     - For credit trades (premium selling), profit target could be **50-80% of credit earned** (i.e., buy back when premium has dropped to 20-50% of original). Stop-loss could be when premium doubles (100% loss) or some multiple. 
     - For debit trades (purchases), profit target might be 50-100% gain, stop-loss ~50% of premium paid (to not lose more than half on one trade).
     - These ratios can be adjusted based on backtesting or user preference, but code them as defaults that can be tweaked via config.
   - **Rolling Mechanism:** Implement functions to **roll positions**:
     - If an option position is nearing expiration or hitting certain conditions (e.g., 5 days to expiry and still far OTM but not at profit target), the system can roll to a farther expiration. Use the API to simultaneously close current position and open a new one (can use `class=multileg` to do a roll spread, or do sequential – but multileg preferred to avoid legging risk).
     - Ensure that when rolling, the new position is similar (e.g., same strikes or adjusted strikes) and that we **carry over the stop-loss/profit-taking logic** (likely need to cancel old exits and set new ones for the new position).
     - Rolling might also be triggered by **volatility or delta** triggers as discussed (e.g., if short straddle starts going wrong on one side, roll that side out and up/down).
     - This logic can get complex, so start with a simple rule: *if an option is  > X% ITM or < Y DTE and still open, then roll to next weekly/monthly*. Keep a log of rolls to ensure we don’t roll indefinitely without realizing losses.
   - **Auto-Reinvestment:** After each trade closes (either via TP or SL or manual close), update the account balance and available buying power. The system should automatically **recalculate position sizes** for new trades based on the new balance (compounding). E.g., if the account grew, trade size in dollar terms can increase (keeping percentage risk constant). This way profits are reinvested for growth. (The code can query account balance via Tradier API `/v1/accounts/{id}/balances` after each trade to get up-to-date equity). 
   - **Execution Safety:** Use try/except around API calls, with retries for transient errors. If an order is rejected, log the reason (e.g., “insufficient buying power” or “market closed”) and handle gracefully (maybe adjust and retry, or abort that trade).
   - **Order Book and Slippage:** When placing limit orders, especially for multi-leg, consider using a price that has a high probability of fill but not too bad for P/L. Possibly start at mid-price and allow a range. Keep track of whether orders fill or not:
     - If an entry order does not fill within a certain time (say a few seconds for market hours), the system can decide to adjust (e.g., move limit a bit) or cancel if conditions changed.
     - We want to avoid chasing prices indefinitely; implement a reasonable strategy to fill or kill orders (maybe use a **fill-or-kill** or **immediate-or-cancel** flag for Tradier orders if available).
   - **Confirmation:** After execution, record the details (order fill price, etc.) in the log. If using OCO bracket, monitor that one of the exits gets hit and then cancel the other.
   - **Example Flow:** Model says bullish on AAPL -> choose bull put spread -> fetch chain, pick strikes -> place order to sell 1 contract spread at $1.00 credit -> once filled, immediately place OCO: buy spread back at $0.20 (tp) or $2.00 (sl) -> monitor until one fills or expiration -> if TP filled, great (log profit); if SL filled, log loss; if near expiration and neither hit, maybe manually close at market on last day to avoid exercise.

6. **Risk Management – Rolling Equity Metrics:**  
   Implement global risk controls using metrics updated in real-time:
   - **Equity Curve Tracking:** Maintain a record of daily account value (mark-to-market). From this, compute metrics:
     - **Rolling Sharpe Ratio:** Compute over last 30 days of daily returns (or since start if less). If Sharpe falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 0 or becomes negative, or below 0.5), that indicates poor risk-adjusted performance. The system can respond by reducing trade size (e.g., cut positions to half until Sharpe recovers) or even halting trading (no new positions) until performance improves. This prevents churning in a bad regime.
     - **Max Drawdown:** Continuously update max peak and current drawdown. If drawdown exceeds, say, 20%, trigger an emergency protocol: halt all new trades and possibly close open trades to stop the bleeding. This is a “circuit breaker”. Less dramatically, at 10% drawdown, perhaps issue a warning (to log or user) and cut position sizes. The idea is to **never let losses get out of control** beyond the user’s tolerance.
     - **Ulcer Index:** Calculate the Ulcer Index over the rolling equity curve to measure **downside volatility**. If it starts rising significantly, it means the account is in a prolonged drawdown. Use this as a signal to be risk-averse. For example, if Ulcer Index goes above a certain value corresponding to an uncomfortable drawdown length, temporarily switch strategy to very conservative (or pause).
   - **Position Limit Controls:** Enforce limits like:
     - Maximum number of open positions at once (to prevent over-diversification or too much to manage).
     - Maximum total exposure: e.g., not more than 50% of account in margin at any time, or if using portfolio margin, not exceed certain risk factor.
     - Limit on overlapping risk: e.g., avoid selling 5 highly correlated put spreads that together can tank the account if the sector drops – the risk module could detect correlation (like all trades on tech stocks) and suggest or enforce fewer simultaneous similar trades.
   - **Day/Time Filters:** Optionally include risk-based time filters: e.g., avoid trading during earnings announcements for underlying (we can get an earnings calendar via Alpha Vantage or other means and skip those days due to unpredictability). Or avoid initiating new trades on very high-volatility days (VIX spike above threshold) – unless that *is* part of strategy (selling premium when high).
   - **Kill Switch:** Provide a manual and automatic kill switch. Manual – user can send a “STOP” command (via API or UI) to immediately close all positions and pause (for whatever reason, like they see market crashing). Automatic – triggers like extreme market moves (circuit-breaker events) could cause the system to flatten positions. Tradier offers market status; also one can monitor S&P futures for limit-down scenarios. If something crazy happens (like market -7% in a day), better to step aside. This is part of being production-ready for extreme events.
   - The risk management should run on every cycle (e.g., end of day or after each trade) to update metrics and enforce rules. If any rule kicks in, log it and ensure the trading loop knows (e.g., set a flag `trading_paused_due_to_risk = True` which the trading logic checks).

7. **Trade Evaluation & Logging (By Day, DTE, Strategy):**
   - Maintain a **trade log** (persistent, e.g., a CSV file or database table). Each trade record should include:
     - Timestamp of entry and exit, underlying, strategy type (a label like "BullPutSpread", "LongCall", "IronCondor"), quantities, entry price/premium, exit price, profit/loss, and duration held.
     - Also store **day-of-week** of entry, and DTE (days to expiration) of the options at entry, and news sentiment at entry, etc.
   - This data will be used to analyze performance by categories:
     - **Day-of-Week**: e.g., see if Monday trades perform better than Friday trades. There is evidence that certain option strategies (like 0DTE) have day-of-week effects. The system should compute stats by weekday (win rate, avg P/L) after enough trades and adapt if needed (e.g., avoid days that consistently underperform).
     - **DTE Buckets**: Compare outcomes of weekly trades vs monthly trades. It may turn out one is superior. For instance, perhaps trades with ~30 DTE have a higher success rate as some suggest. Adjust strategy focus to the more profitable timeframe.
     - **Strategy Type**: Track performance of different strategy types (spreads vs straddles vs long options). If, say, credit spreads are yielding steady profits but long calls are mostly losing (maybe due to IV underestimation), the system can decide to allocate more to spreads. Option Alpha’s research found neutral strategies had highest win rates for 0DTE – we should verify what works in our case through logged data.
     - **Other**: also log **model signal values** for each trade (like model confidence) to see if higher confidence trades do better (if yes, maybe we only take high-confidence signals going forward).
   - Provide a mechanism (maybe a FastAPI endpoint or a periodic log output) to summarize these stats. The user should be able to see a report like: *“Last 50 trades: overall win rate 65%, avg return per trade 1.2%. By strategy: credit spreads 75% win, avg +$50; long calls 40% win, avg -$20. By day: Mon/Tue good, Thu bad. By DTE: <=7 days trades had more volatility in outcomes than 30 DTE trades.”* This information could guide modifications to rules.
   - The logging and analysis ensure the system **learns from experience**. This is crucial for a production system – it shouldn’t blindly stick to initial parameters if real data shows a different optimal path. The design should allow incorporating these findings (maybe not fully automated optimization, but at least flagging to developer/user).

8. **Notifications & Milestone Handling (Account Doubled):**
   - Implement a notification system for important events. The primary one requested: when **account value doubles** from its initial value.
     - Keep track of initial account balance (e.g., on start, fetch account balance and store as baseline).
     - On each update of balance/equity, check if it’s >= 2 * initial. If yes (and not already notified), trigger a **notification**.
   - **Notification Method:** Could be an email (using an SMTP library or an email-sending service API) or a push notification through the PWA (if using web push) or even SMS (via Twilio API) – depending on user setup. At least an email is straightforward to implement: e.g., use Python `smtplib` to send a preset email to user’s address (credentials for an email account would be needed).
   - The notification message for doubling might encourage the user to consider next steps (like pausing or scaling).
   - **Auto-Pause Option:** Provide an option such that *upon account doubling, the system **pauses trading*** (no new trades) until user manually resumes. This could be a user preference (e.g., a config flag `PAUSE_ON_DOUBLE = True`). If enabled, when double is reached, set a flag to stop taking new positions and possibly close open ones to lock in gains.
   - Alternatively, user might want to **scale up** after doubling (though that is inherently happening via compounding). Perhaps the intention could be: after doubling, withdraw original capital and trade with house money – but that’s outside the system’s scope (user action). The system could simply notify and pause, letting user decide.
   - Other milestones: The system could similarly notify on drawdown thresholds (e.g., “Account down 10% from peak”) or other conditions, to keep user informed. But ensure not to spam – limit important alerts.
   - Logging: record that account doubled and any actions taken (e.g., “PAUSED due to account doubling on date X, from $Y to $Z”).
   - Having this milestone handling adds a **human-in-the-loop checkpoint** which can be valuable – it’s a chance for the user to reassess and perhaps recalibrate the system (maybe retrain model with more data, etc., now that capital is larger).

9. **Security – Owner-Only Access & Authentication:**
   - Protect the system with **secure authentication**. Use FastAPI’s security features:
     - Implement an OAuth2 password flow or a simpler API key scheme for the FastAPI endpoints. For simplicity, we can use an API token approach: The user must provide a header `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` with a pre-shared token for any request. The token can be set in config. 
     - Alternatively, use FastAPI’s `OAuth2PasswordBearer` and have an in-memory username/password (since only one user). The client (PWA) would obtain a token by posting credentials, then use that token for subsequent calls.
   - Ensure that **without valid auth, no sensitive action or info is accessible**. This includes starting/stopping trading, viewing logs, or any endpoints that could leak data.
   - Use HTTPS for communication, especially if deploying the interface publicly. If deploying locally or VPN, at minimum ensure the firewall is in place.
   - Do **not hard-code secrets** in the code that gets sent to client. All API keys (Alpha Vantage, Tradier, etc.) should remain on server side. The PWA or client never needs those – it only talks to our server.
   - Provide an **auth mechanism for mobile** – since we likely are using the same token or credential for PWA, that is fine. Possibly integrate with device biometrics if building native app, but with PWA, stick to token auth.
   - Possibly integrate a second factor or at least a very strong token since this controls financial transactions.
   - Keep the Tradier **access token** safe – Tradier uses OAuth for their API; the system should securely store the refresh and access token (or the user’s API key if using that method). This could be in a config file that is `.gitignored` and encrypted at rest. 
   - If the system is running on a cloud server, follow best practices: no unnecessary ports open, use environment variables for secrets, etc.

   - **Mobile Access (PWA):** Develop a simple frontend (this can be a separate step, possibly using a lightweight JavaScript framework or just plain HTML/JS with fetch calls to FastAPI). The PWA should:
     - Allow user to **login** (if using auth).
     - Show **dashboard**: key stats like current balance, today’s P/L, open trades with their P/L, recent notifications (like “last trade closed +$50” or “account doubled!”).
     - Provide control toggles: e.g., a button to “Pause Trading” (which calls an authenticated endpoint to set a `paused=True` in the system), a “Resume Trading” button, maybe a “Close All Positions Now” emergency button.
     - Possibly allow user to adjust some settings like risk per trade or change the profit target percentage (advanced, could be implemented if needed via an endpoint that updates config).
     - Show logs or recent trades in a readable format for transparency.
     - The PWA should be responsive (usable on phone). It can use caching to work offline for viewing last data, though trading actions would need connectivity.
   - Implement the necessary FastAPI endpoints to support the above:
     - `GET /status` – returns current status (balance, positions, maybe current signals).
     - `POST /pause` or `/resume` – to toggle the trading state.
     - `GET /trades` – returns trade history or last N trades.
     - Possibly `POST /close_all` – to liquidate everything (owner emergency action).
     - All protected by auth.
   - Test the security by attempting a request with wrong token etc., ensure it fails.

10. **Modularity & Testing in Code:**
    - Write clean, modular code. Each part (data, model, strategy, execution, risk, web API) should be somewhat independent so that it’s testable and upgradable.
    - Use classes or well-structured functions. For example, a `TradingBot` class that encapsulates state (like current account balance, open positions, etc.) with methods to perform actions (update_data, generate_signal, place_trade, check_risk, etc.) could be useful.
    - **Testing**: Develop unit tests for:
      - Data retrieval (use sample API responses saved to disk to simulate).
      - Signal generation (maybe test that given a certain synthetic input, the model outputs expected category).
      - Strategy selection (e.g., feed a bullish signal and high IV, ensure it chooses a credit spread not a debit spread, etc.).
      - Execution (this one can be tricky to test fully without hitting API – use Tradier’s sandbox and a dummy account with known positions).
      - Risk management logic (simulate equity series and ensure it triggers flags appropriately).
    - Also perform an **end-to-end paper trade test** in a sandbox:
      - e.g., override the model to output a deterministic signal (like always bullish), run the loop for a day in sandbox mode – see that it fetches data, decides on a trade, places it, and sets exits. You can manually move market (or simulate fills) to test TP/SL logic. 
      - Verify trade logs record properly.
    - Include proper **logging** in the code (using Python’s `logging` library). Log important events: “Placed order for XYZ”, “Trade 123 hit stop loss”, “Sharpe fell below threshold, pausing trading”. This will help in debugging and in understanding system actions after the fact.
    - Make configuration (API keys, thresholds like TP% or SL%, risk per trade, etc.) easily adjustable (maybe via a config file or environment variables or FastAPI endpoints). Document these in code comments or a README so the user knows how to tweak parameters.

**Deliverables:**
- A Python FastAPI application implementing the above. It should start a **background trader** (that periodically checks for new signals or manages trades) and expose endpoints for status/control.
- The code must be well-documented with comments, and avoid hard-coding values that should be configurable.
- Provide examples of how to use the API or interface (e.g., how to login to PWA, what endpoints are available for control).
- Ensure that the system can run 24/7 reliably (handle reconnecting to APIs if needed, etc.).

Focus on **robustness and clarity**: we prefer a maintainable correct system over a highly-optimized but opaque one. Consider real-world factors at each step (latency, partial fills, data errors) and handle exceptions so the system doesn’t crash unexpectedly. 

Now proceed to implement the system as specified. Start by setting up the FastAPI app structure, then implement data fetching, model loading, signal logic, trade execution, risk checks, logging, and the API endpoints. Integrate all components and ensure the system is ready for live (or paper) trading usage.
End of prompt. This prompt comprehensively instructs Claude Code to build the desired trading system, covering all 10 strategy points. It can be fed into Claude (in coding mode) to guide the generation of the code, which will directly integrate into a Python/FastAPI infrastructure as requested.
